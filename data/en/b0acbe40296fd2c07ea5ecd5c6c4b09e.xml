Was very windy last night, but okay. West of the country got it worse, I think.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@fishpercolator I like it. Seems to flow a lot better, I think.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@fishpercolator Playing more, I think it’s the fact that they look like buttons, but seem to be obviously links, is what’s jarring. I’d not expect finger on a button in an SPA, for example, but if pressing goes to another page, I think brain expects finger. If that makes sense?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@fishpercolator It’s an odd one. I can’t quite put my finger on it (I know, I know…) but it feels inconstant. I’m still trying to work out exactly why. I think the pie-like menu doesn’t help in that it does use a hand, but behaves like a menu/button.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@fishpercolator @pedantic_git I’m curious: some “links” have a hand cursor, others a more traditional cursor. Deliberate design decision and, of so, why?

(I note some also have a “zoom” cursor, but I can see the sense in that).]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@seanjmoran I’d very much appreciate that. Thank you!

Interesting book. I’d say around 2/3 of it is stuff I already know (Unix command line tools, git, etc) and 1/3 is “how bionif' people would use it”, which is a really useful insight.]]></document>

Not every one is code I’ve written; but most of the really big ones are.
