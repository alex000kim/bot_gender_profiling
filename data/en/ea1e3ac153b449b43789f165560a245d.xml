		<document><![CDATA[There’s no fundamental reason unions or other membership organizations couldn’t have a similarly outsized voice with a small but highly motivated activist base.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Second, NRA spends that political capital effectively by mobilizing its members in GOP primaries, targeting moderate Republicans with electoral punishment and scaring the bejesus out of everyone else.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Unlike unions, NRA is successful, first, in mobilizing a membership base that identifies as gun owners first, largely because “gun owner” becomes a substitute for a broader political-demographic identity.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[But people have overlapping group identities. Many union members are gun owners, as well as Catholic, or gay, or Asian, etc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Like the NRA, unions have and spend relatively little money (compared to their rivals). Their strength is in member mobilization, not lobbying.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is a position labor unions aspire to occupy with the Democrats, but far less effectively.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This demographic aligns with the base of the GOP, but the NRA can act independently of the party, and flexes its muscles by functioning as an external disciplinary check on that party]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Yet the NRA punches well above its weight by transforming itself from a gun owners’ club to a social movement representing a broader demographic, conservative white men who, in 2018, don’t otherwise have an identitarian club to join https://t.co/9OEnzmBpiE]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[“Only” about a quarter of Americans are gun owners, and the vast majority of guns are owned by 3% of the population]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Contrary to the popular narrative, they don’t actually have, or spend that much money. Their PAC is relatively small. They spend about as much on lobbying as the dairy farmers’ association.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[MS-13 is in the news because they are a useful boogeyman for Trump's efforts to paint immigrants generally as criminals. They help justify deportation policies which target their victims far more than the gang itself.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[MS-13 is in the news not for the threat they pose but because Trump wants them in the news, and they make good copy. They are perceived as foreign though not really, they have crazy tattoos, and they use lurid violence to make up for their relative small potatoes status.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Anyone who says the Bandidos might not be worthy of nationwide hysteria would be chastised for ignoring the tragedy of their crimes. Look at how bloody that Texas shootout was. These bikers are animals.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Anyone who says the Bandidos are not an active threat has their head in the sand. As recently as March, a leader was tried for murdering a Hells Angel. 
https://t.co/wpQ8C2jRn9]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[As evidence, we could point to certain high profile cases. The Bandidos were involved in this horrific shootout in Texas in 2015 that left 9 dead. They can point to international ties: they have chapters in 22 countries. https://t.co/F2qtXwBzyc]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[As a thought experiment, imagine if Trump said, instead, that the biggest national security threat to the US was the Bandidos outlaw motorcycle club.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The very fact that Trump makes a big deal about the gang drives headlines, which inflates the perceived scope of their activities. Now, unlike for every homicide in Chicago or New Orleans, every killing linked to MS-13 gets a news article for the crime, arrest, and sentencing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[To make the case, against all evidence, that MS-13 is the biggest national security threat since al Qaeda, the Trump admin recounts the most salacious details of individual murders, whose victims are, incidentally, the same communities which Trump is denying TPS and deporting.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[MS-13 is not nearly as well organized as Mexican cartels, doesn’t make nearly as much money as the Russian mob, and lives hand to mouth primarily through extortion. Its members are mostly teenagers. It targets members of their own community, and especially fellow gang members.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[In the same period, there were at least 1,875 homicides as a result of mass shootings.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[In terms of violent criminal activity, their activities drive lurid headlines but not overall crime rates. According to one estimate, there were 207 homicides linked to MS-13 members since 2012. That is out of 76,472 homicides nationwide for that period, or 0.3%.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It bears repeating: unlike in Central America, in the US, MS-13 is a relatively small player in the world of gangs &amp; organized crime. MS makes up less than 1% of all US gang members based on FBI estimates. It is smaller than the Crips, Bloods, Latin Kings, and Aryan Brotherhood.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It’s always odd when people who have bought into the MS-13 hysteria @ me whenever there is an arrest, as if this is evidence that the gang is running rampant and we should be freaking out, rather than evidence of effective policing. https://t.co/lzSmhlXcba]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[It is also about holding kids hostage in order to use them as bargaining chips with Congress to get what Trump really wants, which is a border wall contractor boondoggle and restrictions to legal immigration.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The Trump administration is blocking people from exercising their right to asylum, a right guaranteed by US law. So this is not about “upholding the law.” It is about choosing to use child abuse as a tool to scare migrants, a deterrent that is both cruel and ineffective.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@rustbeltjacobin Mexico has always been happy to crack down on Central American migrants; they don’t need the US to tell them to do it.

		<document><![CDATA[@rustbeltjacobin This was the promise of the MCC and it hasn’t worked]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rustbeltjacobin Yes, to Central America, Mexico has always been the bully to the north. US pressure on Mexico to create Programa Frontera Sur has reinforced this attitude and would make regional negotiations fraught]]></document>
