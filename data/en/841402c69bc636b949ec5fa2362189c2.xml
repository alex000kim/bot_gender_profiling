		<document><![CDATA[That management of DCC believe another hotel will transform a community that is shadowed by the IFSC is frankly insulting and beguiles an outdated attitude to community development.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[For management of DCC to describe the sale of the former Magdalene laundry site as ‘the chance of a lifetime’ is a bit of a stretch- the North Inner City is a community that is surrounded by commercial infrastructural including hotels of various sizes.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@AnthonyICHH @FM104 No, there really isn’t. Sustainable cities &amp; communities are ones built around public services and infrastructure. We absolutely must do both in tandem.
