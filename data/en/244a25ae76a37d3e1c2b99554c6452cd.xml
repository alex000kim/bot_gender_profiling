		<document><![CDATA[@dwroboheadz @ulyssesapp @ScrivenerApp If she's used to Pages (a rich text editor, with visual styles and so on), then Scrivener would be the most similar.

If she has access to a Mac, perhaps suggest she uses the trial version of Scrivener, and reads the tutorial. It'll explain the app's approach.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@invalidname @dwroboheadz Yes. Ulysses uses iCloud, and Scrivener uses Dropbox. Both apps work on Mac, iPad, and iPhone. Scrivener is separate purchases on Mac and iOS, and Ulysses is a single subscription which covers both platforms. Scrivener has a Mac trial available, and Ulysses has trials on both.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I'm actively glad to see Iron Fist gone. Love the universe, but that damned guy and the writing; ugh. Hated it. I have no strong feelings about Daredevil either. But Luke Cage is a real loss. Jones is my fave by far, followed by Cage.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ScottACroucher Even just from Cherry:

Blue: tactile "bump" part of the way down (where it triggers), plus a click.

Brown: bump, no click. Softer than blue too.

Red: Linear switch, like pressing a spring. No bump or click. Blacks are a stiffer version of reds.

Etc. Get a tester to try them!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ScottACroucher It's a more nuanced typing experience. I find that, subjectively, it feels softer on the wrists, but naturally requires more finger-extension. This is the kind of keyboard I mostly used until I was in my twenties. There are plenty of other switch types too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ScottACroucher Well, there's a great deal more travel; probably 3-4x times the Magic Keyboard. But these are Cherry MX Blue switches, so the actuation/click point is part of the way down. You don't need to "bottom out" (fully depress) the key for it to register, so it feels softer than the MK.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The good thing about this is I can either:

1. Unplug the adapter from the iPad, and take the iPad away, or;

2. Unplug the Lighting power cable from the adapter, and lift the whole stand/iPad/keyboard rig to take to another room.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[People asked about using the mechanical keyboard with my iPad. I use the Apple USB 3 Lightning adapter, which has a Lightning input (for power) plus a USB 3 input, and connects to the iPad's lightning port. The keyboard uses a micro USB cable. I've lashed it to my Lamicall stand. https://t.co/L7GDVjPrLR]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@BenCraib It's more about the pitch and resonance of the clack. These keyswitches are Cherry MX blues, which are clicky. You can listen to comparisons of these switches and others, both with and without dampeners, here: https://t.co/nSOBD4p6eD]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BenCraib For certain tasks, like writing, I daresay that'd work just fine.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@andiih So odd! I mean, I look at these blank keys and it's like a 5% opaque superimposed set of glyphs, totally happening in my brain. Which is weird too, of course — but amazing. I wonder if your sort of journalistic memory is more accurate for details though?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@andiih Aye, I can sort of intellectually imagine the difficulty. Seems like your memories must be hyper-selective, then. I have loads of ambient detail in mine. I can "see" any notable decor in restaurants that Lauren and I went to years ago, for example, right now, no problem.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I do also have a full set of keycaps in a UK Mac layout (black caps, white text, including Mac-style fkeys). I changed these ones over to the blanks. I'm now pretty good at it, 88 keys later — even the costar-stabilised ones with the little brackets and silicone grease.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Most importantly, the switches are Cherry MX Blues, with 0.2mm dampening o-rings installed under the caps. It makes an _amazing_ noise. https://t.co/zJ3wcZfcVx]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Regarding the blank keys, it's no problem if you touch-type. Also, my memory/perception is a little odd (I can remember things like license plates for cars parked on the street, years later). When I look at the keys, I "see" the glyphs, very nearly visually. Maybe everyone does?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Purple keys are for modifiers, and to help cue my eye — particularly for keys that were in a different position on my Magic Keyboard. In the rightmost portion, the upper purple key is for Eject (toggles software keyboard on iOS), and below the two purple are page up/down. Handy. https://t.co/GWrAny2ok2]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[This is actually a perfect match. Facebook needed someone with no credibility whatsoever, who's used to being constantly overruled by a long-faced scruple-free opportunist who gets sweaty when questioned and likes the colour blue. Clegg's qualifications are impeccable. https://t.co/GXN1mDxEll]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jatowler Well your hands aren't moving far from the home position, so it's whatever minimal extension can hit ⇧ easiest. For me, that's the left pinky, with virtually no movement at all.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jsnell Apple has some serious questions to answer about this barking-up-a-tree, howling-at-the-moon _mental_ cursor key arrangement, though. What were they thinking? https://t.co/5U0OkjIOPZ]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DaveWoodX @jsnell Dave, it's OK to just like putting rhinestones on things. Nobody's judging you here, mate.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DaveWoodX @jsnell Interesting that Space and Shift use the same hand too. I assume you're right-handed, as I am?

I understand the Backspace thing; there's something especially satisfying about hitting a key with your middle finger. I think it produces the most explosive force.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jsnell And I say all of that as someone who has touch-typed (via my own organically-developed system) since I was a wee lad. I don't look at the keys. I type very quickly indeed. I type all day long. I've never had typing-related RSI. It just seems to work for me. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@piparkaq @jsnell A good mechanical keyboard will let you make that change via config (or dip switches). People often just get rid of caps lock, and change it into an additional left ctrl.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_tmkly Shift with left thumb is indeed odd. I use too many keyboard shortcuts for that. How would you do, e.g., ⌘⌥⌃⇧T or something with your thumb on ⇧?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@jsnell (What's an ISO Return key, Matt?)

Glad you asked. UK/etc Return keys aren't the horizontal, Shift-like things you're used to in the USA. They're upside-down L-shapes, and they're brilliant to hit. https://t.co/RS69yBsL3t]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I had no idea that @jsnell was a right-Shift-key user. Honestly, I had no idea that such people existed, but now I wonder if I'm the weird one. My typing habits:

Return (ISO): always right 4th finger
Backspace: right 3rd finger
Space: left thumb
Shift: left pinky
Cmd: left thumb]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@RothParsons I did wonder why you were tweeting at this hour from the west coast.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@RothParsons Thing is, when the context is American, I'll usually use the US pronunciations — for English. The music app on Mac/iOS is Garageband, and I say it the way Apple does: "Guh-RAHJ". Here, the word 'garage' is pronounced "GAH-rij".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@scottmag I think that's worse, though, isn't it? And I bet I know why: the pernicious assumption that US consumers must at all costs not be challenged intellectually. Harry Potter and the "Sorcerer's" Stone, and all that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[(Relatedly, pretty much everyone here in Scotland I've spoken to about the upcoming Mary Queen of Scots movie had the same reaction: Um, why doesn't she sound a lot more French? She spent the majority of her childhood there. But there's a US-friendly Scots accent instead.)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@friendsofdarwin Tis almost the season for Christmas-cracker jokes again, right enough.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You also kind of bounce off the "la". The "cr–" sound is just a little farther back in the top of the mouth than the "ch" in the Scottish word "loch". (I hear that word pronounced as "lock" often, and that's very wrong too.)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Phonetics in plain text is imprecise and inherently relative to your native perception of vowels etc, but I think you're on the right track! From an English-speaking perspective, croix is something like "k(r)wa", with the usual top/middle-of-mouth, slightly crunchy "kr" sound. 🇫🇷 https://t.co/IccoHlcEsQ]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I mean, maybe it was just on a couple of youtube videos I've seen. Maybe those specific guys just somehow had never done any French(?). I've never seen a US TV ad for La Croix, in fairness. Maybe the official pronunication is correct; could be.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If you're going to butcher the français that badly, why not just change the label to literally "La Croy" or something?

("Because it looks less sophisticated!" Hate to break this to you, but pronouncing croix as 'croy' doesn't _really_ come off as sophisticated… 🇫🇷)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Having just watched a YouTube video, it has ONLY NOW occurred to me that when Americans mention "la croy" in the context of soft drinks, it's the brand La Croix they're talking about. 🤭

I've never tried the stuff, but that's… just nowhere near how you pronounce that word.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@seanreilly Superficially, but it's a very different beast. Evolved from the old music-labels connect, and lags behind the apps side of things. I think they briefly shared code, but the developer portal has long since forked and been hugely enhanced.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@andrewje_home I find it idiosyncratic, corporate, and substantially less intuitive than the Apple OSes.

		<document><![CDATA[Trackpads feel so _weird_ to me now. It's 90° off-axis from the pointer, and like 15 centimetres away. It's like I'm controlling a robot arm in the next room.

		<document><![CDATA[Nonetheless, using a modern, touch-based device — which means the interaction design much more than the hardware — for two years really changes your perspective. You get used to how streamlined and human-optimised things can be. Going back to the Mac, it's busy and confusing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I love the Mac community. I loved System 6, and 7, and Mac OS 8 and 9, and NeXTSTEP. I stood in line for Mac OS X 10.0, and .1, and .2 etc. I _loved_ being a Cocoa developer, and an iOS developer. I wrote a lot of code for Apple, mostly for macOS. I am A HUGE MAC FAN.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I should make this clear: I love the Mac. Love it; so much. It's why I got interested in software development as a real job, rather than programming as a hobby. It's thus why I got my degree in Comp Sci, and met my wife. I've had a fantastic prior career that stemmed from it.]]></document>
