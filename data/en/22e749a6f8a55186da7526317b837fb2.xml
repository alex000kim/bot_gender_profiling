		<document><![CDATA[@StevenDovahkiin I actually think he did change tbh. Not playing Sterling and starting Gundogan was a concession. This is good on it https://t.co/rxjP00CewN]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Struggling to think of a worse performance by a supposedly elite team in a big knockout CL tie. Completely soulless first half and didn't test the keeper once in the second. Guardiola should be hammered for this and rightly so]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@SteTudor123 An absolutely shocking performance so far. Staggeringly bad]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thehuwdavies Guardiola is rightly lauded, but he's already left Anfield with his tail between his legs this season and clearly learned nothing from it]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@cccccameron Drinkwater in particular an absolutely laughable signing to begin with. Monaco seem to have sent Bakayoko's clone and Barkley hasn't been fit for a year]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JohnBrewin_ I wouldn't have thought so looking at the standard of player in that squad]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JackRathborn Overall though, given the budget Chelsea have, missing out on top four is unacceptable. And it's entirely preventable]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@AshleyConnick @ReturnOfDKD Yeah, spot on piece. The main issue is the complete lack of a long term strategy]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@No1isChelsea I agree to an extent, but the complete lack of a long-term plan is the main issue. What is the purpose of an academy if those players are never given a chance? Why is no coach backed?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MulraneyGary The entire structure is strange. They have the best academy in the country, yet sign worse players in the same positions for 25 million]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@cccccameron Loaning out Ruben Loftus Cheek only to sign a crock in the same position, lunacy]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JamesHeydenrych Very strange, because he was immense for Monaco. It's as if they signed his stunt double]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JackRathborn Undoubtedly, but in the current PL climate it's not sustainable bearing in mind what City, Spurs and Liverpool are doing in particular]]></document>
