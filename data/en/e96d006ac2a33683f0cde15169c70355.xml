It’s invisible, intrusive, hateful, irritating, frightening &amp; it can be constant. It’s so hard to explain

When I have #anxiety it makes me doubt absolutely every-freakin-thing I do

Oh... and luckily, anxiety is usually temporary &amp; it can be treated or managed😊 https://t.co/IxMIAZOZeU]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@PJWNHSPtSafety 🤦🏻‍♀️ unfortunately so... but I had great crisis care from @NHS_ELFT so my recovery was swift &amp; smooth. Check out my thread, yesterday I think, about how receiving “outstanding” services feels like. Amazing stuff 🤗]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@PJWNHSPtSafety Thanks Pete @PJWNHSPtSafety I’m doing great now thanks. A short, sharp, unexpected relapse... but had excellent care, was honest and open about it &amp; looked after myself too... so I’m feeling so much better. Thanks for checking on me 💐]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@LiluWheeler @NHS_ELFT There are many many other options than train tracks. All mental health trusts have a crisisline, most 24/7. The Samaritans are amazing &amp; many towns have drop-in centres. There are loads of other MH charities too, as well as using other community assets 🏊‍♂️🚴‍♂️🌼🦆👯‍♀️]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@LiluWheeler @NHS_ELFT Sorry to hear you’ve had ➕&amp;➖ experience
When I’m unwell I feel so vulnerable I just want to hide away. A busy, noisy A&amp;E dept is pretty much the last place on earth I’d want to be 🤯 

And yes, I agree... in healthcare we should run towards problems, rather than away from them]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@LiluWheeler @mattwRMN I agree there should be MUCH better information about alternatives to A&amp;E for people in #mentalhealth crisis. I understand there are new facilities at @RoyalLondonHosp and many mental health Trusts are now working on alternatives through the “crisis care concordat” 👍🏻]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mattwRMN Great to see initiatives coming up across the country for alternatives to A&amp;E for people with #mentalhealth problems. @SWLSTG is a good example 👌🏻 based on a model from Birmingham (I think). Crisis Cafes such as @sabpNHS &amp; @NHS_ELFT also very effective alternatives]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@LiluWheeler My experience is consistently fantastic BECAUSE  I live in the catchment area of @NHS_ELFT it has nothing to do with my job, my role or even my presence on social media. The Trust is rated outstanding &amp; all the care I have seen other people receive has been the same Fab quality]]></document>

After a final appt with the psychiatrist I was discharged on 12th July

In 2 weeks I’d benefited from intensive support, daily contact with HTT, medication review, CBT &amp; I was well on my way to recovery

✅This is what Crisis Support is supposed to look &amp; feel like 🌚➡️🌝]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[8/11
As well as all the face-to-face &amp; phone support from the @NHS_ELFT HTT  I was also signposted to the #hackney  #crisiscafe, free online #CBT and #IAPT therapy

Well done to @NHSHomerton &amp; @CityHackneyCCG for collaborative working &amp; excellent commissioning 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 https://t.co/WjpCePGFQa]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[7/11
The team asked if there was anything else that may help me

🤔 Some #CBT for anxiety would be helpful... and as if by magic I received a call from HTT #psychologist the next day and two sessions of very helpful Cognitive Behaviour Therapy completed that week https://t.co/USxlcXdxLX]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[6/11
The psychiatrist liaised with the pharmacist &amp; new prescription arranged &amp; meds collected from Hospital pharmacy

The team even offered to bring the medication to me at home! But I picked it up myself]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[5/11
The psychiatrist &amp; whole HTT made me feel supported, valued &amp; like I mattered. This is crucial for people with depression &amp; anxiety

Every contact with the team felt genuine &amp; un-rushed with a strong focus on #recovery #Wellbeing &amp; 24/7 compassionate community focussed care https://t.co/APmJmYdPQv]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[4/11
Comprehensive, thoughtful &amp; challenging assessment by (lovely) psychiatrist.
Assessment was about MY needs, not ticking boxes or KPIs

-What would help me?
-How can the team help?
-What’s helped me in the past?
-Would therapy be of help?
-What meds have helped me before?]]></document>
