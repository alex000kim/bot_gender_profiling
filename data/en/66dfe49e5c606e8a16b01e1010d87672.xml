		<document><![CDATA[@jamesgallagher @Cyclistie @dublincycling @DublinCyclists @cyclingindublin Thanks but the OP is only 5ft 2 this bike is quite big so they'd need to be 5ft 6 minimum. Plus I don't know if I'd recommend it for 6km daily cycling as it's pretty heavy. It's more a short hop bike!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Anyway, Screen Unseen is something that happens @ODEONcinemasIRE pretty regularly - it's always a film that hasn't been released yet, guaranteed to be one they think is a future classic and, for the wusses among us, never a horror film.

		<document><![CDATA[I think it's probably for the same reason that I don't generally watch trailers for movies before I go to see them - nor do I read reviews. I want to go in with zero clue and be able to make up my own mind! I rate movies based on whether they are BTJA or WJA]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[As someone who does not enjoy surprises (what? we exist and we matter!), I was surprised by how much I enjoyed not knowing what the film was at the last @ODEONcinemasIRE Screen Unseen!
