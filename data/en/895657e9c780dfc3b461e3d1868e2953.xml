		<document><![CDATA[@fleur_charms @beckybarnesblog I never said you hate anyone for their size, but it was hard to ignore that you advocated for thin people with EDs and dysmorphia saying whatever they want but not seeming to care if it hurts fat people with EDs and dysmorphia. It signals that you value one group above the other.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@fleur_charms @beckybarnesblog Nobody is saying peope should never use the word fat, if we were we wouldn’t have reclaimed it, but I don’t think it’s unfair for fat people to ask for it to not be used as a synonym for or in the same breath as “hideous, ugly, disgusting, awful, lazy” etc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@fleur_charms @beckybarnesblog exclusive and hurtful language, but you seem to not care about fat people facing those same challenges.

		<document><![CDATA[@fleur_charms @beckybarnesblog Overweight does not necessarily mean unhealthy, and there are many reasons why people are overweight, some of which have little to do with diet and exercise.

		<document><![CDATA[@fleur_charms @beckybarnesblog There absolutely is. “I’m struggling with my confidence today” “I feel so unattractive today” “I’m bloated” “I feel like I need to work on my body” are just some of the many ways you can express discontent with your body without throwing fat people under the bus.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@fleur_charms @beckybarnesblog Fat people have eating disorders and body dysmorphia too, and them having to listen to thin people say “I feel fat” is incredibly damaging. Just choose different words, it’s not hard.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@bellahappyfeet @fatnutritionist Yeah, I never watch those shows anymore. It’s just so frustrating to start watching a show and you begin to enjoy it and then there’ll be a few episodes with anti-fat jokes and comments.

		<document><![CDATA[@fatnutritionist I think one of the worst things for me is when some thins say “why shouldn’t we be treated better, we worked hard to look like this” when so many didn’t work hard at it at all. That’s just how they look naturally, regardless of what they eat, and without lifting a finger.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@fatnutritionist @bellahappyfeet Genuine question, how do you avoid fatphobic tv? Like there are some obvious shows to avoid, but fatphobia is, to some extent, present in pretty much every tv show ever and I just don’t understand how that’s possible but would very much like to know.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kayleerumsberg Fair enough. I agree that if someone makes a comment about another person’s body, however wrong that is, the right way to deal with it is not by commenting on their body in return.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kayleerumsberg I don’t think it implies that, she made the tweet to say making comments about people’s bodies isn’t ok, so why would she do it back? I think it meant she’s not letting them get away with it and will tell them the actual reason for the weight loss, ie. “I had an organ removed”.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kayleerumsberg What do you mean by making the same comments? Was anyone suggesting on commenting on their body in return? If someone did that’s not cool, but I don’t see anything wrong with the OPs approach in responding. It’s just being honest and giving the person a reality check.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kayleerumsberg Does that not apply to people making unsolicited comments about other people’s bodies? Why would I make them feel good about that if it hurts me? Why shouldn’t I calmly tell them it’s unwanted if it keeps them from hurting others in the future?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KevinGall67 @VivMcGregor made an intentional effort to lose weight is great, but unsolicited body comments or “compliments” can have the complete opposite effect. I don’t understand why that’s so hard for you to grasp.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KevinGall67 @VivMcGregor You realise you’re making a huge generalisation when you assume everyone wants to be congratulated on weight loss, right? I recognise that compliments like that can be a big boost to some people, that’s why I stated in a previous comment that complimenting people you know]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KevinGall67 @VivMcGregor I honestly don’t think asking people not to comment on your body &amp; pointing out that it can be very harmful is acting offended or bitching and moaning. I think it’s good to make people aware, and I think you’re the one currently moaning and complaining🤷‍♀️]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KevinGall67 @VivMcGregor Sure you can, just don’t comment on other people’s bodies unless you know it won’t cause damage. It’s really not that hard.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CherryAnnAustin @KevinGall67 @VivMcGregor Yup, been there myself with bulimia. The compliments completely messed with my head.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KevinGall67 @VivMcGregor And for some people it can be extremely damaging. If someone brings up that they’ve been trying to lose weight, feel free to congratulate. But unsolicited comments can be harmful.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kayleerumsberg @VivMcGregor @punnysamosa If it stops them from making the same assumptions and comments about someone else’s body, it absolutely is okay. It’s not their place to comment on other people’s bodies, and doing so can be incredibly damaging.]]></document>
