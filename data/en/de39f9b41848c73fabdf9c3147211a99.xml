		<document><![CDATA[Mrs G is away on business, so I'll be doing a bit more reading this week. What are we all reading at the moment?

A book I've recently enjoyed is The Condor Prophecy, from the Hiram Kane thriller series by @StevenScribe

		<document><![CDATA[@valentinourbano Depends how you count them. CHANGER had a massive rewrite after the first draft; it was traumatic. The revised draft then had a number of editing passes. If you count each edit and proof-read individually, I know there were at least 13! But really I'd say four major drafts.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@darylbaxter It's a perfectly manageable size. I keep a dressmaking measurement tape in a drawer in my office alongside the usual carpenter's one, mostly to assess sizes of new Apple gear in comparison to my various messenger bags and backpacks.

		<document><![CDATA[@Office My wife spends her life in Outlook and Excel. We use OneNote to coordinate book marketing. Excel for budgets and schedules. Word for proof reading. We could get by without PowerPoint mostly, but Excel is non-negotiable!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Edenwaith I plan heavily, and almost never skip around. I'd have to be in dire straits. What I'll sometimes do is add an isolated idea or snippet for a later scene into my notes.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@bennusekabel Use whatever suits your process best. Photos can be useful. For characters, I keep bullet-point biographical info, a handful of background paragraphs, and whatever introduction/reintroduction text I use in the book. Important stuff to add as you go: injuries, changed appearance.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Being a writer: long periods of silence, broken up by occasional bursts of this. (It's a blank video; sorry — I don't know how to put just audio on Twitter.) #mechanicalkeyboard https://t.co/9FOpRPbX7g]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[2. Last, but by no means least, the most valuable piece of writing advice you'll ever see…

Backup your goddamned work regularly. Not on the same computer. Don't keep backups in the same physical location. If you lose it all, it's your own fault.

Thank you. Good luck! 👍]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[1. Don't question whether you're a writer. There's no entrance exam, nor should there be. Writers write. There are far more people who think they're writers and aren't, because they're not in the chair and hitting the keys. I hereby bestow writerhood upon you. Now that's done.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[But the general baseline advice is: write first, edit later. You can edit crap, but you can't edit nothing. If you're in real trouble, go ahead and skip forward to sketch out a scene you're dying to write. That's still progress.

Two final pieces of advice, most important of all.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Try not to edit while you're writing; again, "while". If you get a good routine going, some people (me!) find it helpful to re-read just yesterday's words each morning, and do a light edit. I then backfill any research stuff. Then, in the afternoon, I actually write.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If you're really having trouble, look at it a different way. What I do is, instead of thinking "What happens next?", I instead ask myself "What's the next thing I _need_ to happen?". Figure out the waypoints ahead, then see if the path between is clearer (virtually always).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Try writing at the same time each day, in the same place. It can help. Also try stopping each day when you have a very strong sense of what comes next; jot down a couple of bullet points instead of the prose, and you've got an easy start the next day. It's half the battle.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If you haven't made them in advance, make them as you go. As you invent biographical info or personal characteristics (for people), or relevant ambient detail (places), update the sheets. You'll thank yourself a hundred times later when you refer back to them.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[There's a specific kind-of exception to the no-researching rule, and it's this: use your sheets. You should have one Character Sheet per major character ("faces"), and one Location Sheet per major location ("places"). Might be a city or a single building.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[A good placeholder is something that'll never occur in the text. Nonsense is fine, like YYYYY or whatever, but ideally use metadata, like a comment in Word, Scrivener, or Ulysses. Bonus points if your app can give you a quick list of just those things later, and jump to them.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Don't do research while writing. Note that I said "while"; I mean don't be writing, then stop to look something up, then continue. You'll wreck your momentum. If you do nothing else, invent a placeholder that means "FILL THIS IN LATER", and use it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[(I recommend KM Weiland's Structuring Your Novel. If you want a nice chart of her ideal structure, it's on her site — I made it!)

Now, stuff that trips me up while writing, or: lessons I learned the hard way.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[That said, I do highly recommend outlining. Broad strokes first, then iteratively refine until you're sick of doing so. I usually go down to the granularity of groups of a few scenes, and sometimes further. I also recommend reading about the three-act structure.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[One common way to categorise writers is those who plan/outline first (planners), and those who just wing it (pantsers). I'm a planner, so really I'd say: hey, plan a lot before you start. But it's already 1st November, so I'm a bit late with that advice.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I've never written 50k words in 30 days, for #NaNoWriMo or otherwise, but I've written two 95k+ novels. Does that qualify me to offer some opinions?

JUST KIDDING; I'm a man on the internet, so _of course_ I'm going to share my opinions, whether you want to hear them or not… https://t.co/hI9ZFVY49e]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#SmashBrosUltimate looks bonkers. I've had it pre-ordered since day one. Looks like the guiding principles were:

1. Epic fanservice
2. Esports
3. RPG-style min-maxing
4. Never having to make another one, ever again.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@NateBarham @MTrokielewicz I think Laura should do all of them. While she's still settling into her confidence on stage, the recorded video voiceover was excellent. Better than Phil's. I'll always like Jony's, but it's entered the cultural lexicon and can be hard to distinguish from self-parody now.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[It's the start of #NaNoWriMo! All over the world right now, aspiring writers are cleaning the bathroom, vacuuming the hall carpet, organising the spice rack, and finally clearing out those boxes in the garage like their lives depend upon it.

		<document><![CDATA[I especially love the little sweepy brush, like you're just grabbing a household tool for a minute — rather than doing something requiring profound understanding and empathy, which people practice their whole lives to achieve effectively. 🥴]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@sammio2 That's the reality of the situation, and has been true for every Smart Keyboard, 3rd-party keyboard case, the vast majority of regular cases and covers etc for virtually every iPad and iPhone. Ideal? No. But why choose to be annoyed when it won't change? Cost of integration.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@four_sides The effect of a sale is also at least 95% due to promotion, not price; a price drop alone has negligible impact, though it's proportional to ranking, so it's self-reinforcing. It also varies by category/genre, etc. There are a lot of moving parts.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@four_sides Sales are always in parity, and only affect ebooks. Paperbacks are print-on-demand, and thus have very little flexibility in the margin. There are also contractual constraints, particularly that Amazon requires to be at least equal-cheapest across all competing stores.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@chrisphin Though really it _should_ mean what people assume it means. It's too lovely a word to still have such a narrow, unintuitive definition.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KyleHughes Now that _is_ cool. We'd absolutely use that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@chrisphin I refuse to even characterise that sort of sane, sensible, reasonable response as reactionary. It's the children who are wrong.

		<document><![CDATA[Fave wallpapers from the new Apple devices: MacBook Air, definitely. I'd love to get those for the new iPad.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Oh, and about the Apple Pencil 2: I've used the first one for two years, and it looks like they fixed _everything_ about it. More grippy, won't roll away, always attached, always in reach, always paired, always charged, no cap to lose, and no awkward charging position. Exemplary.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Hey I hope you like tweet threads, because I have no shortage of white dude opinions on ultimately unimportant stuff.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I will say that the Folio looks excellent. I always want the back of the iPad to be covered, and (finally) the part that touches the screen isn't the same part that's been directly against some random, filthy coffee shop table. 👍 Just give me a purple one!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[For now, my on-the-go solution is a Magic Keyboard wrapped in a @studioneat Canopy, and I prop the iPad up on that. I also use a flexible silicone back-case for the iPad itself, though they don't seem to be available yet for the new iPad Pros (hurry up, China).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Neither point is a deal-breaker, but there's just enough annoyance and added friction that, coupled with the £200(!) cost of the 12.9" Smart Keyboard Folio, that I haven't pre-ordered one. I'll try it in the Apple Store when I get the chance.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[(Yes, you can have the suggestions bar still visible even with the software keyboard hidden — it's the default behaviour — but I've explicitly hidden it, for the aforementioned full-screen immersion and space while writing.)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And Eject is most useful of all on iOS, because it means toggle the on-screen keyboard. I use a physical keyboard at all times, but you need the virtual one for emoji, 3rd-party utility keyboards, and (in my case) suggestions — which include password autofill.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Regarding function keys, Mute is of obvious utility, when all web sites and social media apps are desperate to spew video at the least provocation. Yes, there's control centre, but it doesn't let you quickly toggle off then back to the previous volume with one keypress.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Now, granted, I'm on a 10.5" iPad Pro right now but I have the new 12.9" one arriving next week. The difference in size virtually makes up for a potential orientation change: 10.5 portrait is only 8% taller than 12.9 landscape is wide (not counting Home-indicator padding).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I write for a living. Well, I write, anyway. Portrait is much more page-like, particularly in @UlyssesApp where you can hide all the UI while typing. It's very, very useful to have more paragraphs of visible context. I'm reluctant to lose that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I really want to like the Smart Keyboard Folio, as with past Smart Keyboards, but:

1. I use my iPad almost exclusively in portrait orientation.

2. There are no function keys, and I heavily use Eject and Mute.

More about each of those points…]]></document>
