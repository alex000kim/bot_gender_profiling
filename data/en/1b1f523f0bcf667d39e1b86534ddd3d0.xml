		<document><![CDATA[@darrenrovell @SuiteHop I’d say that’s really quite reasonable given usual hospitality costs. We don’t get parking spaces and unlimited alcohol all the time...]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Joe_Pecchia @Charlie_Boss Curious to know the size/relation of their investment, but they do invest in a lot globally. Mobile games getting serious traction out there currently but given device proliferation, not a surprise. Joe might be on to something ;)]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@sdloote Wouldn’t expect them to announce during season but I can guarantee they’re talking to potential franchisees for future seasons. That’ll only ramp up as Season gets under way]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Link is still working. https://t.co/NmkAlSlCp2. Same for all other teams. League hosting all team sites in a templated format. Makes sense from OWL perspective. Wonder if they were allowed to develop their own standalone ones or if these were part of the franchise agreements.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Annnnddd...they’ve deleted the tweet with that link.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Or, I’m reading into it too much. That’s just what I’d be doing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I’d bet they’ll anonymise the data and distribute to franchises whilst giving each their personalised analytics too. League hold the full data and can then make League wide partnership decisions based on what they know.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If they’re savvy (they no doubt are), they’ve integrated a domain wide marketing automation tool that’ll slow them to identify fans by dwell rate and link profiles further down the line.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Interesting. Appears franchise sites sit on a central domain ala @NBA. This means the League get all key data for each franchise and can analyse, monetise etc. https://t.co/6JcZlwBf0D]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Just helped next door break into their own house after they left their keys on a night out. Good deed done. Amazing what you can find on Google.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@klacobprime talking tons of sense here. @warriors are one of the most progressive sports brands in the world. Would love to see a big EU sports brand give it this level of thought. We have the talent; it just needs a bold step in the right direction from the club owners. https://t.co/BRe2ssq6ja]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Unless OFC there is no appetite for OW in the UK. Be curious to know how the player base breaks down regionally and whether that factored into franchise distribution.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[With the OWL starting next week I’m really interested to see when they announce opening up more slots. If LA can get 2 slots with a pop of less than 4m but they don’t give LDN another (8.7m as you asked) I would have serious reservations.]]></document>

💪 Think you're good enough to go pro?

💪 Take part in the #ChallengerSeries…]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@ClemMurphy Yup. First purchases of 2018!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[7. Keep March 3/4th free. Put it in your calendar now. Player Media day. Headshots, interviews and preparing you for the Elite Series. We provide media training and advice from experts in PR, the social networks and our casters. Incredibly valuable.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[6. Capture your gameplay if possible. Crude highlights, crazy goals, insane combos. Show off those skills! Challenger is online only and between players so most matches can’t be watched - perhaps stream your attempt to make top 30, build an audience!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[5. Understand what’s required of you. The Elite Series is a weekly offline event. You may need to be travelling each weekend. If you’re European that can be tough. Heck if you’re a few hours from London it can be a challenge. Prepare for that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[4. If you can, stream. If teams can’t see you and get a feeling for what you’re about, you’re just a number. Teams want personalities, not just performers. We survey all draft players but teams want to know you before it gets that far!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[3. Get your socials in order. The Challenger Series is all about identifying talent. Make the top 30 for draft? You better be sure you’re active socially and up to date. The more info teams have on players, the more likely to draft them.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[2. Play as many Cups as you can. G-points mean climbing that leaderboard. Finish in the top 30 and you can be drafted. Consistency &gt; One big win. Don’t rest on those laurels!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[1. Complete your Challenger Series profile on the website. Franchises see who’s winning in the Cups and topping the Leaderboards - if you have your Twitter handle in your profile as well as location etc that makes it far easier for them to scout you!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@MonteCristo I’m not sure it’s perceived that way, but each to their own. I imagine we both have more important things to be getting on with than discussing the semantics, but appreciate the discussion. GL with OWL for the rest of the season, enjoying what’s happened so far.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MonteCristo My umbrage is the tone you take with Ben. Don't hate on him having some fun. Hype is hype. You're good at what you do, so's Ben. You each have your areas of expertise. Opinions are great, but belittling someone who's striving for the same thing?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@PwntByUkrainian @Jade_7295 very much so. sarcasm doesn't come across well in my initial tweet. I experienced/followed him with Renegades.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Jade_7295 Happy to agree to disagree. GLHF bud 😀]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Jade_7295 That's cute. Let's remember the only side of the story really highlighted has been Monte's side. As for Gfinity, you obviously don't read too much about us. Regardless, let's leave the conversation here - I don't think anyone's getting anywhere eh?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Jade_7295 Regardless, you do you. It's good that you back Monte up, and I appreciate your opinion and the discussion. Have a good one buddy :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Jade_7295 I've 10+ years in various forms of marketing strategy, comms and talent management. But ok. Endemic problem in esports with anyone who dares question the validity of the 'veteran'. And as for the team, look how that went..unfortunately.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Jade_7295 I can literally run you through all the ways we work with teams to support marketing strategy, team development, player management and support. No stretching here. 10 teams, 200 players.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Jade_7295 It's nothing alike. Monte is a professional in analysing Overwatch and the player's involved. Not the marketing strategy, logistics, operational or comms part of what the teams do. If you believe they're the same, that's your prerogative. 👍]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Jade_7295 Yes, not like I deal with teams, their marketing and their management for a living. Okeydokey buddy.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Shlobashky0505 @MonteCristo Dictate was a poor choice of word. Influence is more appropriate.]]></document>
