		<document><![CDATA[@JillKrop @BobKronbauer Striking point but streaking can also mean to move at a high speed or to rush, as in, he was streaking across the field. Does that make him a streaker, before he was struck?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BobKronbauer @VIAwesome I don't know what your parameters are but for my money it reads too formal (despite "destroyed") and has too many words. A simpler, more efficient and catchier head would be: 
 
"Streaker struck by BC Lion hires lawyer"
OR
"Streaker downed by BC Lion lawyers up"

Just my #2cents]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Alexthecarrigan @elmhirst_jamie @drex My point was that our collective tolerances for things have changed -- assault, included. So this fan trespassed. That fact does not give player right to potentially injure him. This is my take -- it does not require your endorsement -- and vice versa.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Alexthecarrigan @elmhirst_jamie @drex Not saying he'd be charged but, having lived through 1982, I can say, with some confidence, that one cannot get away with what one got away with, back in that day.
