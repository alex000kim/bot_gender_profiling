		<document><![CDATA[TL;DR – my neighbours were silent and lovely. AirBnBers are arguably lovely (who knows?) but not silent. Living next to a couple who care about their neighbourhood &gt; living next to transient groups of tourists who stand outside your bedroom window lamenting the cost of taxis. FIN]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Plus – and I know this to be true as I have hunted down the listing – their two-bed terraced home in Dublin city centre now sleeps EIGHT PEOPLE (how?!), which I guess explains why the shower is also on. But eight people trotting around on wooden floors? That's a lot of trotting.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I have grown to sincerely resent AirBnB since my neighbours moved to Spain and turned the house next door into a full-time AirBnB. In fact, I resent it so much that I don't think I will ever stay in an AirBnB ever again, though it may make travel difficult.]]></document>
