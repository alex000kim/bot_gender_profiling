		<document><![CDATA[@MemphisBraves @tamisawyer @JHoustonHill What climate?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MemphisBraves @tamisawyer @JHoustonHill 😂😂😂😂😂  So now you assume that I assume all white ppl are racist.  This thread is actually funny to me.  Your actual tweets are just deflection and innuendo.  Try not making things up and not speaking for me?  Now back to you "Mr. Least Racist".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MemphisBraves @tamisawyer @JHoustonHill Bruh, you are putting words in my mouth at this point.  I never said that at all.  I live and operate in a very diverse circle.  YOU said you are "least racist".  Explain to me how could it mean something that I "wish" when you do not know me and you said it by second tweet?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CoachAntBrown I like practices so competitive that coaches almost come to blows.  😂]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MemphisBraves @tamisawyer @JHoustonHill Bruh, I'm still trying to figure out how one is "least racist".  Then turn around and clutch pearls.  Are you also "least sexist"?  Just curious.  You said it not me.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MemphisBraves @tamisawyer @JHoustonHill I know.  You are right.  I mean, after all, you are a "least racist" person.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MemphisBraves @tamisawyer @JHoustonHill "least racist".  That's really a term ppl use?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MemphisBraves @tamisawyer @JHoustonHill Ok.  I agree with you.  They will vote conservative.  However, more often than not, a lil' racism goes with that conservatism.  Ppl her age are the children of those who supported Jim Crow.  Old habits die hard.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DuvalSimmonds @Movest @SethOnHoops He says this like it's a bad thing.  Nothing wrong here.  If you are a basketball player in college then it makes sense that you wold transfer for basketball reasons.   Right?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MemphisBraves @tamisawyer @JHoustonHill 😂😂😂😂😂

I guess the public hanging comment is just how "yall" talk down there.  Nope, no racist intent at all.  Even though she attended segregated schools, openly wishes the confederacy won and openly supporting voter suppression.  too funny.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The fact that Dems are or will be competitive in statewide races in GA, FL, AL, MS and TX is crazy.  Not even thought of a few years ago.  2020 will see Trump having to campaign and spend in states that should have been easy for him. https://t.co/rNivRY678m]]></document>

Can go on and on.  As for the specific one on depression not sure but these rankings are horrible.  Definitely a pattern.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@daniecal I am speaking actual data and facts.  Not feelings or going with my gut.  The fact is MS is ranked near last in almost all quality of life polls.  (education, upward mobility, mental health, health care, etc.)  And they continue to vote for republicans over and over.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@daniecal No.  A ranking is a ranking.  They are ranked 50th by Mental Health America.  The rankings are done by criteria and data.  McKinnesey and CO. do a state rankings also using publicly available data.  They are ranked 50th.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@daniecal According to Mental Health America MS is ranked 50th.  Their website has the criteria (providers, access, substance abuse, etc..)

The folks in that state are active participants in their own demise.  They are literally voting to ensure a status quo that is leaving them behind.]]></document>
