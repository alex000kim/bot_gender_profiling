		<document><![CDATA[@charlesarthur Thanks. My impression (maybe wrong?) was that apps need to specifically listen for cmd-period too/instead; not an automatic substitution at system level. I'd have to check for examples where Esc worked but cmd-period didn't.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ianbetteridge @tiedtiger I've been very impressed with Office on iOS.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@therogueslife Hey, thanks!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@AndyNicolaides Cheers!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mediocre_Tech Thanks, Kevin. 👍]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tiedtiger @ianbetteridge I can't pretend to use them extensively or to anything near their full capability, but I do use Numbers a fair bit, and my wife and I have various shared Excel spreadsheets. I find Google Sheets to be clunky and webby, though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Aehmlo Ah, thanks. I think that's my blog's fault for stripping the escape character before the " character in the description (it's there in my master Markdown copy, I swear).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@agentkramer Thank you!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@RionRobinson Well now I'm nervous.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dennyhenke @dkhamsing Always the keyboard. I almost never touch the screen while writing. Ulysses has good keyboard-navigation support for that stuff.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@daveymoz I know, right? It's a beauty.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dkhamsing I have a (big) mechanical keyboard, connected via USB. My iPad sits on a Lamicall stand, which you can find on Amazon. Here's a photo. https://t.co/m6rCyQRKDO]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@darylbaxter Most exciting so far is my USB-C positive-angle adapter. https://t.co/JiHrTDuqVq]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@hugoBessaa Just for fun? A lot of thrillers/adventure stories (Mariani, Rollins, Brown, Cussler, Crichton). Always a decent bit of horror too (King, Koontz, Lovecraft). Occasional sci-fi. It's rare for me to read non-fiction to relax, but I geek out about typography and timepieces.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@hugoBessaa You can ask questions any time, mate. 🤓 I'm taking the dog out for a walk now but I'll reply when I get back.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Edenwaith No. Pumpkin pie isn't a thing in the UK. I'm sure there are specialist places that have it, but it'd be very rare. The two most common sweet/dessert pies here are probably apple and rhubarb.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@chriswb Every year, mate. But the bright colour choices for the XR will certainly do. Mrs G is also getting one.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@bbccdde I got the first 12" MacBook, and had three full replacements of the keyboard (i.e. top case) under warranty. Apple finally gave me the next-generation model for free. I don't use a Mac anymore at all, though.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@joey_green I've never regretted it, and I can now say that I honestly don't miss software development. I loved my dev work, but writing is what I'm supposed to do.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@wookiee ¯\_(ツ)_/¯   I never look it up. I prefer the mystery. It's not like I can ever get another bottle, after all.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@CraigGrannell @fpocha The Folio will be more convenient and portable, and the Magic is nicer to type on. That said, you adjust to the Folio quicker than you think. Yes it's flat and slappy and a little stiff, but it's perfectly usable, and comes with big ancillary benefits.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I should have mentioned: I wrote TOLL on the iPad Pro I'm selling. Whether that's a plus or a minus is up to you… 🤓 https://t.co/wiaYriCrJ4]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CraigGrannell @fpocha It's what I always took when we travelled and I wanted to work. It's been all around Scotland, plus bits of Spain, Italy, etc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@fpocha @CraigGrannell I loved it. It's surprisingly stable even on my lap, but I mainly used it on tables and desks. It completely protects the Magic Keyboard in a bag, and lets you use the iPad in either orientation. And it uses micro suction to hold the keyboard, so no issues with weakened adhesive.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Hey folks, I'm selling my perfect-condition iPad Pro 10.5" (256 GB gold wifi), plus Apple Pencil, Magic Keyboard, several cases/covers and accessories! Full info here: https://t.co/2VYML8kF6k https://t.co/vWejPsrdyq]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Madril I think it's perhaps too big/heavy for that kind of reading, but everyone has their own preferences!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Madril If I'm using it away from my desk, it'll either be on a table surface with the Pencil, or in the Smart Keyboard Folio. I don't hold it up for anything. I read on my Kindle, or brief periods on the iPhone.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@sanguish Oh god it really IS about accountability.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tomworthjr I always had a flexible, transparent TPU back-case on previous iPads, but suitable ones aren't available yet for the new 12.9 (they lack a full cutout to accommodate the attached Pencil), so I've been using it without a case. It feels great, though I do worry about scratching it.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Had the 10.5" iPad Pro out again to erase it and box it up for selling. What a _gorgeous_ and ultra-portable thing it is. I'm glad I have the 12.9" now since I'm mostly desk-based, but I'll certainly miss this thing. https://t.co/FGXHfp8sDf]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@invalidname Just needs that first comma to become a question mark. Might also italicise the "I", depending on how much verbal emphasis you want to create.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@krugazor Well if I did a live-stream while writing, people would certainly see enough suffering and cursing. 🤔]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@invalidname The _real_ rule in writing, though, is just the rule of least surprise. When conventions are ambiguous and/or the prose becomes awkward, restructure the sentence to avoid those problems.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@cocoaphony There are vast swathes of land within an hour or so from various airports around central Scotland. As to the logistics, immigration conditions and so on, I've understandably never looked into it much!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@krugazor Sure, but you're some kind of contractor and software engineer, right? So of course your clients' interest would be accountability. What we were talking about, though, was live-streaming writing. Writers are virtually never paid by the hour or similar.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@afallon02 I do have one to provide filename-suitable dates for backups, but most of my writing-related automation is within @draftsapp. I use scripts there to HTML-ify my weekly members' newsletters, update the online back-issues archive, and various other things.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@erynofwales @ladywhimsy That's probably most of it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@invalidname Think of it like this: transform closing punctuation into a joining/attributive comma, EXCEPT where you would either be:

1. Doubling-up punctuation (e.g. "!," or "—,"), or
2. Damaging meaning/grammar (e.g. turning "?" into ",")

When in doubt, grab a book and check.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@invalidname None of those! It's:

"Who's there?" she asked.

We never put the joining comma outside the quotes in fiction (we do in non-fiction). Full-stops (periods), commas, and semicolons become joining commas for speech attribution, but !?-–—: are all retained.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@krugazor I don't think it's to do with accountability. I think it's curiosity and also a desire for calming content.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@darylbaxter That's a stupid controversy. With less RAM it'll be slower, assuming there aren't memory management bugs, but that's all (and it'll hit storage a bit more). My assumption is that the RAM bump on the max storage spec is aimed at heavy duty photographers etc, and that's fine.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@darylbaxter What's that about?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@iotize I use it more for project management than writing (I use @OmniOutliner for writing-related outlining).
