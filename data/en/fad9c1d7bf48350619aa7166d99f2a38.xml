		<document><![CDATA[@Tuckwitme10 @Coach_Coffer @CoachSherm5 He might be the best role player in the league.  But he is a role player on the Warriors.  Nothing wrong with being a role player.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Coach_Coffer @CoachSherm5 @Tuckwitme10 I'm gonna have to disagree.  Draymond is a role player.  He basically waved off a top 3 player then gave him the business (verbally) in the huddle.  That's a big deal imo.  But they will prolly release a snapchat video of them dancing or something so who knows.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Tuckwitme10 @CoachSherm5 I dont see KD demanding that Draymond get traded during season.  I was talking about after the season.  As in "I will not sign this 1 yr deal if Mr. Wont pass me the ball in crunch time is gonna be here".  But Steve Kerr gotta handle that also.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Tuckwitme10 @CoachSherm5 You will agree that KD has all the leverage while Draymond has none.  Right?  I mean is it even a choice between the two?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CoachSherm5 @Tuckwitme10 😂😂😂😂😂😂]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Tuckwitme10 @CoachSherm5 Thats my point.  And that is coming up this year right?  I'm sure KD can deal with not getting the ball.  But to try to show him up and out talk him.  Draymond acting like that player that let his barber &amp; trainer gas him up a lil to much.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Tuckwitme10 @CoachSherm5 I just saw the full time out video.  Draymond really took it there in the huddle.  Kept talking at him, Boogie had to walk him away.  Durant looked like he was holding back really going at him.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CoachSherm5 @Tuckwitme10 This is where the coach needs to step in and explain the roles to the players.  Draymond was way outta line.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Tuckwitme10 yup.  KD was heated.  And had every right to be.  And Draymond acted like he wanted to throw hands in the huddle.  Will be interesting to see how it plays out.]]></document>
