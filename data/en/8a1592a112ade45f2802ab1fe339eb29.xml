		<document><![CDATA[@Edenwaith He just lies in all kinds of weird positions. He fits into that bed just fine when he wants to (though his primary overnight bed, in the living room, is much bigger).]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@RothParsons Can't remember what prompted recent interest! I think I'll keep it at home for now, and retain the Magic Keyboard for out and about. Apple has a Lightning power pass-through plus USB3 dongle.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@cherrymx All that remains now is to order a hugely expensive and bespoke mechanical keyboard. &lt;moments pass&gt; OK, I've done that too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@cherrymx And the tester has now become my fidget toy, of course. Plus occasional pretend DESTROY THIS PERSON ON THE INTERNET button.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I got my @cherrymx switch tester. Top-to-bottom, left-to-right, they are:

Linear: red, black, grey
Tactile: brown, clear, grey
Tactile + click: white, blue, green

O-rings are installed (my office is bare walls and a wooden floor, plus wooden desk — harsh sounds).

Fave: blue 💙 https://t.co/V63N0dZhKU]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@shawnblanc You were right. I don't like the feel of the browns and other bump-no-click variants. Greens are too heavy with click, and blue seems just right. Clears are nice too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Can anyone recommend an #alexa compatible motion sensor (indoors; it's just for setting up auto-lights)? Bonus points for not needing a third-party hub thing. More bonus points if it has a light sensor too (don't want lights on if it's daytime).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ayaz_khan 100% typing here!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ayaz_khan Ah. 🙂 Why browns over blues? Less clicky, lower actuation force?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ayaz_khan MKD?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Edenwaith It's a tester indeed. I'll customise a board, but not make it myself!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Aehmlo The lilac is epic. I worry about the white base/caps discolouring. Any sign of that?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CastIrony And which did you prefer?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@garrettmurray At this point, I don't need a second job for Christmas. 😊 So I'm mostly likely to just spec up a WASD, which means either MX blues or browns. I've got a tester coming to play with. Building a board is some way off; just dipping my toes in!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Aehmlo Got a tester with nine different Cherry switches, caps, o-rings, and a puller arriving tomorrow.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CastIrony Too much! That wouldn't help me choose.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Aehmlo How did you spec your WASD? I'd always go tenkeyless, probably MX blues, maybe with the shallower o-rings. Then I'd spend two weeks picking keycaps.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@shawnblanc I remember you having a DAS too. I held off on the Smart Keyboard because I wanted the iPad further away from me. I'm probably going up to the 12.9"(?) Pro when new ones come out. I'm reeeeally tempted by a WASD. Just need to break the psychological barrier of having a cable.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Aehmlo I think I've given up on Bluetooth for now; the options just aren't convincing, and all seem to use custom caps or worse. I'm considering a WASD tenkeyless, and just getting a USB adapter for the iPad.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@shawnblanc I'm leaning heavily that way, but my office is exclusively hard surfaces; brown might be better. 🤔 Which keyboard(s) — or indeed builds — are you especially fond of?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@kolovalex I've been on the list for a while, but it's always just "coming soon".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Really I just want this glorious, perfect, magnificent keyboard again, but with bluetooth. Snickety snickety snick. https://t.co/UofjjEjyV0]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@alehandrof I love it. Nice big target for my right pinky finger. I naturally hit it high up, in the crossbar portion, so on US-style (Shift-style) Return keys, I often strike the key above accidentally.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TomZosh Basically you find the song, add it to a variable, then get your usual playlist, shuffle it, add that to the same variable, and play it all unshuffled (because it's already shuffled from song 2 onwards). Here's the shortcut to import:

		<document><![CDATA[@_rogerogden Any time in my life that someone has asked me that question, the next thing they suggest has been too expensive.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@digitalmozart Saw that. I like it, but… US-style horizontal Return key is annoying. Plus it's kickstarter, so you never really know if you'll get ripped off. :/]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Stefan51278 A mechanical keyboard? No they don't; not for years now. If you're thinking of the Magic Keyboard, that's a dome-switch keyboard, not a mechanical one.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Can anyone recommend a Bluetooth mechanical keyboard? No numpad, please. Mac layout. Significant bonus points for UK caps, and inverted-L Return key.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@jaysee_au I can't have _a lot_ of caffeine, that's true — hence decaf coffee. Pepsi Max is around 20% (or less) of the caffeine of an equivalent volume of brewed coffee, roughly. (Note that Pepsi Max has ~50% less caffeine than the US version, Pepsi Zero Sugar.)]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@nwreg I totally agree, for what it's worth! But the option to sneak a peek is (usually) there, if needed…]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@darylbaxter I remember that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@paulbfrandsen @draftsapp Well, I hope you were starting from at least ambivalence. 🤔]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mattcassinelli Aye. I use it for timestamps in things, filenames for backups, and so on. I tweeted a link to the shortcut itself earlier.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@nwreg (You know you can often access issues early? They go up in the archive when they're finished, not just once they've gone out…)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@iravgupta Using it now!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I knew someone would ask about that. I drink a lot of Pepsi Max — probably too much. My wife likes to have metrics for things, so I'm keeping a log of whenever I finish a bottle and put it into the recycling (just a timestamp in a @draftsapp document). No doubt I'll be horrified. https://t.co/Ro9sQC8YY4]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@rossmcalli You'll also want to get the version from The Bourne Ultimatum, which I'd say is the second best (after the Jason Bourne version).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@nggalai Oh and I hate the icon, and the tiny/low-contrast text everywhere. But feature-wise, it's the best I've used so far.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@nggalai My fave at the mo. Don't love the look, but: stacks, renaming, data subtypes, notes, labels (tags), _and_ it's a file provider. 👍]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tantramar I do use and really like Copied, but the shelf aspect is an afterthought (pretty much just text-based data, plus images). Also, not updated in ~6 months. I'm keeping it as a clipboard/snippets manager. I want something for common files.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@nwreg Well you're only spoiling things for yourself, Regine… 😁]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@unsubtlewoods @viticci I love(d) Yoink on the Mac, but the iOS version — even the brand new version 2 — doesn't seem to do tagging/labels/categories/folders, and I feel that I need that.]]></document>
