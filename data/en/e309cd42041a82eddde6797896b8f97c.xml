		<document><![CDATA[Very few diaspora Mexicans voted, just 98,470, though this double the turnout from 2012. Politicians don’t campaign for the votes of migrants but for migrants’ perceived influence over the votes of relatives back home. See my analysis for @TheWilsonCenter https://t.co/eTNGWlpysD]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[AMLO campaigned in 8 US cities even though this is technically against Mexican election law. This was a big change in campaign strategy from 2006 when he refused to go to the US at all. He was helped by electoral reforms that eased registration abroad.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[But diaspora Mexicans were never a reliable base for the PAN given their socioeconomic diversity. Having failed to halt corruption and violence after two terms in office, the party had squandered much of its legacy as the party of democratic change among Mexicans abroad.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[For 2 decades, the default opposition party for Mexicans abroad (mostly US) was the PAN, beginning with Fox, who had widespread diaspora support. In 2012, Vázquez Mota won the largest vote share in the diaspora despite getting the smallest vote share overall.]]></document>

64.9% López Obrador (MORENA/PT/ES)
26.8% Anaya Cortés (PAN/PRD/MC)
