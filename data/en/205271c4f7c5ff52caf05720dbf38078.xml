		<document><![CDATA[@diisforiia @sxrpnch @Kirstie_Schultz Modern disposable straws are made from polypropylene or polyethylene which releases no harmful chemicals when used with hot drinks (unlike carcinogenic BPA).

		<document><![CDATA[@ChloeInCurve Sure, not a problem!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ChloeInCurve @CallieThorpe Yeah they’re a great reduction alternative, but unfortunately not a viable option for many disabled people. This chart explains some of the reasons, though it doesn’t go into allergens and the fact one can’t bite down on some of them. https://t.co/gOwtHIP1p5]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CallieThorpe As a disabled person I really appreciate that, especially with the audience you have.

Thank you for that.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Joe_Beef @Kirstie_Schultz I’ll argue till the cows come home when people are harrassing me &amp; arguing that my existence should be made even more difficult just cos I want to change the focus of the activism to targeting the worst offenders rather than those that need plastic straws to literally survive.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Joe_Beef @Kirstie_Schultz Again, why should coming up with solutions fall on disabled people? And now you’re twisting my words. To reiterate, the OP isn’t blocking people just for arguing, she’s blocking them for arguing that her actual life isn’t important. Did I do that to you? And you’re fucking right]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Joe_Beef @Kirstie_Schultz care about the environment, but rather than actively campaigning to make our lives more difficult, we all, abled and disabled, could get together to campaign against the biggest offenders, ie. corporate and industrial waste, rather than putting the onus on marginalised people.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Joe_Beef @Kirstie_Schultz Yeah I never said *I* argued it was just a turtle, I said others argued the life of a turtle was more important than that of disabled people. I also never said abled people shouldn’t reduce the use of disposable plastic straws, and I in fact explicitly said that disabled people]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Joe_Beef @Kirstie_Schultz When that tiny difference would negatively affect thousands upon thousands of disabled people and make their lives even harder than they already are, I think it’s fair for actual disabled people to call .03% tiny.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Joe_Beef @Kirstie_Schultz The OP has been dealing with ableist assholes arguing that a turtle is more important than 1000s of disabled ppl, I don’t blame them for hitting the block button vigorously, I’d do the same thing. If that’s what you meant, fair enough, but it didn’t come across that way.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Joe_Beef @Kirstie_Schultz disposable plastic straws would make life infinitely more difficult and in many cases more dangerous for us. The efforts shouldn’t be focused on something that will ultimately make only a tiny difference to the environment, but a huge difference in the lives of disabled people.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Joe_Beef @Kirstie_Schultz You said “Way to look for a solution that works for everyone” to me, a disabled person. What else was I supposed to take from that statement? It’s not like disabled people don’t give af about the environment, we all do our part and we all care, but the obsession with reducing]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Beckzlugo @Kirstie_Schultz So focus on reducing the thousands of types of plastic waste that isn’t necessary for disabled people to live. And you can’t seriously argue that people listen to disabled folx when dozens of people, you included, are trivialising/ignoring our need for disposable straws.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Joe_Beef @Kirstie_Schultz Why should coming up with a solution fall on disabled people? As if we don’t have enough bullshit to navigate in every day life? How about just not banning disposable straws and focusing on the corporations and industries who cause the most damage getting their shit together?]]></document>
