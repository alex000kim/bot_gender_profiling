		<document><![CDATA[@TheMemeWarrior @TheReelMohan @saranimd @jfagone So they banned box cutters even though PEOPLE did the cutting?  Interesting concept.  Banning an item to save ppl's lives.  Why didnt the gov't just go with the "thoughts and prayers" route?  And still allow box cutters on planes?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheMemeWarrior @TheReelMohan @saranimd @jfagone "Yes but we didn’t ban box cutters everywhere." 

 And most folks (including me) are not trying to ban guns everywhere.  Trust, if you could kill 40 ppl with a box cutter thee would be legislation and rules governing purchase on them.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@TheMemeWarrior @TheReelMohan @saranimd @jfagone That is a real weak attempt at a rebuttal.  The point is that YOU MENTIONED 9/11 and boxcutters.  I showed YOU how the government responded to that attack.  We are talking 9/11.  I do not want to ban guns everywhere.   Now, let me go google the last MASS BOX CUTTER event.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@TheReelMohan @saranimd @jfagone Interesting that you bring up 9/11.
