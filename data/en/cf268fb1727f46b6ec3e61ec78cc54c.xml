		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean And no, she wouldn’t do it differently &amp; I commend her for taking this stand. Her example serves to highlight the clear bias towards policing women’s behavior vs men’s. https://t.co/rNcrDHtQ5B]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean This has less to do with policing her behavior and more to do with judging how the ump handled this call. Apply the exact same standard to male tennis players &amp; I have no problem with the call. But this isn’t the case at all.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean Fuck that. Plenty of male tennis players behave like this all the time &amp; aren’t penalized for it. It’s a clear double standard. Applied more harshly always for women (especially women of colour). Joe MacEnroe was a classic example of shit attitude. This didn’t happen to him.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean Why don’t you ask the umps who’ve been threatened by male players over the decades of men’s tennis. Maybe you’ll find you answer there.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean I said it’s “like”, I didn’t say you said it. But frankly, the comparison holds. Blaming those who stand up for their rights / victim-shaming is a slippery slope. She owes nobody any do-overs to appease their privileged sensitivities.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean Sure the situation was overall hard for everyone. But I will *always* prioritize a person’s human rights over someone else’s hurt feelings. Otherwise, human rights just don’t work. That’s my priority.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean No, I can’t accept that. Policing her behaviour is like suggesting women who wear short skirts had it coming when they get raped. The line for me is very clear when it comes to supporting human rights.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean Well, frankly - lucky for you this won’t ever happen to your kids. So it will be much easier for them to “take the high road”.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean It’s unfortunate the other tennis player got caught in the crossfire, but she’s not disrespecting anybody by standing up for having her human rights violated like that. She owes no apology.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean She wasn’t disrespecting her opponent. She was sticking up for herself. If the ump didn’t want so much drama in the game, he should have checked his racist sexist views before the game began. She owes no apology for standing until for her basic human rights.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean On the back of also being “disciplined” at the French open for wearing a suit intended to prevent blood clots &amp; all the microagressions she’s endured to date for being a woman/Black/etc, I don’t blame her one bit for being absolutely done with it. Full empathy from me.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean That was AFTER he treated her badly. So what. She’s standing up for herself. Good for her.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean This is also part of the problem. She didn’t “threaten” anybody. She called the ump “a thief” for stealing a point. But people often perceive “emotional black women” as threatening (aka racism). No, she’s deeply invested in her game &amp; upset at unfair calls. Same as male players.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean Threatening? What are you talking about. She called the ump a thief. She didn’t threaten anybody.
