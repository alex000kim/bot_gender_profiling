		<document><![CDATA[Yes, I guess you could say that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Yeah.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Eh? Not bad.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[With that weak soccer..?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Your wish to protect what you love overlaps with my feelings. That will bring out Avatar Armed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Think about what you want to protect and wish to gain even greater strength.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Zero Magnum!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Tenma, are you still willing to fight after this?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is my team, Ancient Dark's forest. Outsiders are not allowed here.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Calling it a god is a little over the top..]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Fortunately, all of you are Avatar users.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Everything will be made clear from this match!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If only there was something else that could them a push.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It does! No, it already has.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Soccer was what decided human worth.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Tenma. I'm glad I was able to help you. Make sure to take back the real timeline.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[No, we're done here.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[All I did was push you from behind.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Block it!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Nice to meet you too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Guys, keep your eyes closed and listen to me. Quiet down your heart.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Maybe because I've been kicking the ball ever since I was young.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I don't really know. I got acquainted with them a little while earlier and they let me join the team.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Wondeba. Join me and Tenma together!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[They've evolving even more than I imagined. Did Raimon's coach anticipate that they would improve this much from that practice?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Tenma.. I'm sorry.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Yes, I guess you could say that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I had a lot of fun, Tenma.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Yeah, let's end this.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The girl that was on the losing side was sacrificed. That was the rule.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[No way.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[She was sacrificed. He couldn't protect his own sister.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[We won't lose!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Alright. If you win against us in soccer, I'll allow it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I want to give their heightened feelings a boost.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Think about what you want to protect and wish to gain even greater strength.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Raimon is just stronger than we thought. That's all.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Everything will be made clear from this match!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Unless you're strong, you're worth nothing!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Yeah.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[My power will pull you up.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Thanks, Hakuryuu.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Tenma, why did you save it back then?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Your wish to protect what you love overlaps with my feelings. That will bring out Avatar Armed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It was fun playing soccer with you. Thank you, Tenma..]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Soccer was what decided human worth.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Not bad, Tenma. Impressive.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You want to use Avatar Armed, don't you?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Never mind that, Tenma.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Yeah, I'm fine.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Train, huh..]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It does! No, it already has.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Um.. Well, it's because you guys are interesting! Especially you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Sorry. I can't go.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Hi.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Here. A symbol of our friendship.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Tenma. I'm glad I was able to help you. Make sure to take back the real timeline.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[No, we're done here.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Yep. You're interesting.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Leave them to me.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[With that weak soccer..?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Calling it a god is a little over the top..]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The soccer god here will definitely help you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[He bought the match with money, but then the villagers found out.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I had a lot of fun, Tenma.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[That's why he made the other team promise to lose intentionally, quietly slipping them a token of his gratitude.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I want you to get an understanding of Avatar Armed on this island.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You'll definitely need Avatar Armed to fight these guys.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Block it!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Alright. If you win against us in soccer, I'll allow it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Hakuryuu.. I wonder what kind of soccer we truly hoped for in the depths of our hearts.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Thanks, Hakuryuu.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Soccer isn't something to enjoy like you seem to think it is.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It's easier to concentrate in this area.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Hakuryuu?!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[No.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This island used to hold matches that were similar to soccer.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[One year, during a long dry spell, this ball was used to decide who should be sacrificed in order to save the village.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I want to give their heightened feelings a boost.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If only he had the conviction that he would win, and the courage to fight. Then maybe he wouldn't have done such a thing..]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Darkness God Dark Exodus!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So you have some skill.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Yeah, let's end this.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[No way.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[She was sacrificed. He couldn't protect his own sister.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You kind of rushed that one.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Now, let's begin training for Avatar Armed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[No, we're done here.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Tenma. Soccer is merely a tool to determine people's value. Without power, you won't be able to protect those precious to you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Wondeba. Join me and Tenma together!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I only hope this wind will lead them to Avatar Armed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Nice to meet you too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The force of those feelings will draw you and your Avatar closer.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Fortunately, all of you are Avatar users.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Give it up! You won't be able to do anything with your power!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Alright. If you win against us in soccer, I'll allow it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The girl that was on the losing side was sacrificed. That was the rule.]]></document>
