		<document><![CDATA[@micahtredding Even though the data is permanently accessible and exportable, even if the subscriptions expires or is cancelled? They're explicit about that. It's frankly disingenuous to use a word like "hostage" in this context.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Apps will still have to be updated for the new 12.9" model despite the identical pixel dimensions, though. The Home indicator thing alters vertical layouts.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Pixel dimensions of now-current iPad Pro models:

iPad Pro 10.5" (2017) — 2224 × 1668 px
iPad Pro 11.0" (2018) — 2388 × 1668 px
iPad Pro 12.9" (both) — 2732 × 2048 px

The 11" is 164 pixels larger on longer side than the 10.5", and identical on shorter side. 12.9" is unchanged.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[The thing they didn't really mention, but which we expected, is that the new iPad Pro models don't have a headphone jack. Apple now has a little USB-C to 3.5mm adapter you can buy.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Looks like the Smart Keyboard Folio is designed so that you can leave the Apple Pencil 2 attached to the iPad Pro at the same time.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I went for the 12.9" iPad Pro this time. Also chose Space Grey, which is a first for me. Still 256GB wifi as always (I'm always at home or in a coffee shop with wifi, and have my phone as a hotspot if needed. I've used about 42GB on my iPad, so any more than 256 would be silly.)]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I really love it. "This is the best iPad we've ever made" — well, … yeah. You mean you _didn't_ decide, you know what, it was too good before so we're going to make it more crap this time, just for a change?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Right, let's do this keynote nonsense. Here's hoping for a Face ID iPad Pro, thin bezel, in the big size. Maybe a new Apple Pencil with tap/swipe gesture support.

May Santa Tim bring what you most desire… within the context of luxury consumer electronics. 🎅👩🏽‍💻]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[It's been years since I've watched an Apple keynote live (the whooping kills me, and I need to be able to skip it — and the third-party demos), but I think I'll make an exception this time. I'm excited about new iPads.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@epoz The challenge is figuring out possible threat models, not the tech. There's certainly some image processing to be done to match a screen bitmap region to a video stream, but some clever person can surely figure that out these days.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@epoz An iCloud-connected Mac (same account, logged in, same wifi) could temporarily show a verifiable pattern in a region with characteristics that matched the viewfinder, for handshaking. iOS and macos already do that for transferring settings to a new device, pairing a Watch, etc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MTrokielewicz @laurengemmell Looks like the area of a foreground leaf was mapped as background for blurring. Seems like that'd be over-zealous edge finding/smoothing rather than a Focus Pixels issue.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@usedarkroom I'm not seeing screenshots I've taken in Darkroom; just photos. The regular Photos app usefully shows both. Do I have something misconfigured?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@chrisphin @halidecamera It is indeed. A little scary with the depth mapping.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@wookiee My habit now is:

1. iPad puts up the "use Touch ID to &lt;whatever&gt;" alert with the red fingerprint thing.

		<document><![CDATA[@DjAtkins I disagree with some of her notes — though comparatively few. She's quite gentle about it. It's more a case of her being the person I most want to impress!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[When they get rid of Likes on twitter, how am I supposed to efficiently convey "I want you to feel seen, but now you are DISMISSED"? There are some seriously layered semantics on that little heart icon these days. I'm only about 30% kidding.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@MaxSen_G Thanks!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Black_Kettle No, because when you see someone with a photo of a computer screen, it's because they do their social sharing etc on the phone, not the computer, like the vast majority.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MaxSen_G Yes, please go ahead. Thanks for asking.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@AndyNicolaides Yes, but if you think about it, you'll realise that's the exact opposite of what we're talking about.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And yes, AirDrop and all that, but normals neither know nor care — plus it's a huge hassle. Grabbing your phone's camera is intuitive and convenient. It's tech's job to close the gap and magically fix it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[We finally have the technology to solve this problem.

1. Phone detects you're using its camera to photograph a computer screen.

2. Phone talks to computer, works out the proper region, and computer sends phone an actual cropped screenshot instead.

Get to work, Apple/etc.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@erynofwales In a US news context, it's been my experience that "on" is very commonly omitted before a day name in summaries, headlines, etc — including spoken segments. "In a statement Tueday, …" / "Widely expected to be announced Wednesday".]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Thought: it's much easier to use a Home-button iPad alongside a Face ID iPhone than I expected, because the iOS 11/12 iPad-specific gestures already teach you to swipe up to switch apps.]]></document>
