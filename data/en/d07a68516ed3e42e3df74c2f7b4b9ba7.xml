		<document><![CDATA[I’ve been confused by @JohnTory since this debacle began. He was slow to respond initially, when he did it seemed weak &amp; now he flip flops, while maintaining he’s “standing up for Toronto”. His lack of consistency &amp; conviction makes me question his authenticity. Disappointing. https://t.co/pN8dsGS89t]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean @JulieSLalonde @IDontBlog Yes, I follow her here and there. Didn’t see her comments about Heinen? It doesn’t change my perspective on due process however.

		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean @JulieSLalonde @IDontBlog Hmm. She wasn’t making reference at all to Marie Henein or other lawyers.

		<document><![CDATA[@IDontBlog @Mamaofabean Where we differ is that you seem to believe feminists owe women otherwise “betrayal” whereas I don’t believe they owe anybody anything. To me, feminism means women are free to do/be whatever a man can do/be. Men don’t shame each other for betraying their sex. Same difference.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean @IDontBlog Same ethical standards doctors have to take on the grossest possible patients or psychologists have to take on the most severe mental illness cases. Choosing is UNETHICAL. They have a professional duty to provide care/service in accordance with their standards of practice.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean @IDontBlog It’s not that simple. She has an ethical duty to take on clients to defend and not prejudge them. That’s not her role ever. That was completely cave our judicial system of lawyers played that card.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean @IDontBlog I respect that she does NOT play judge and jury all by herself. That kind of premature bias is also very troublesome in our legal system. I would want to know my lawyer has my back fully &amp; does their job, regardless of their personal feelings about me (right or wrong).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean @IDontBlog But you don’t know the situation until AFTER the trial. At least, not in cases where it’s not so obvious. To suggest you don’t respect a lawyer for seeing due process through doesn’t make sense to me.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@IDontBlog @Mamaofabean I respect her for being a true professional, not subjecting her clients to bias or prejudgment, for holding court like a boss in front of all that media hype, for not giving a fuck what people think about her vagina/hair/outfit/shoes and bringing her lawyer A-game.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@IDontBlog @Mamaofabean Can you imagine if we had a system where all defendants were ‘gut judged’ as guilty or innocent before they even got to court based on... feelings? Wow.

		<document><![CDATA[@IDontBlog @Mamaofabean My own armchair opinions aside, defending clients well is part of being a good criminal defensive attorney.

		<document><![CDATA[@MissTwosday @Forbes @ADP You don’t have to like the technical definition of implicit bias, but it is what it is. It doesn’t take away from the severity of what happened to Black Americans.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MissTwosday @Forbes I totally understand the feelings behind your perspective (I am also Black over here friend), but no - that’s not what implicit bias is limited to.

		<document><![CDATA[@MissTwosday @Forbes @ADP I think everyone should take it since unconscious bias goes well beyond just skin colour: disabilities, sexual orientation, gender, etc. Sadly, being a person of colour does not protect us from unconscious bias, even within communities of colour.]]></document>
