		<document><![CDATA[@dokfranco The category is lowest resting heart rate, so yes, you have to be healthy — in the sense that the bradycardia can't have a pathological or artificial cause. (There might be other record categories for those?)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Trivia: a slow heart rate is called bradycardia, and the Guinness world record holder* — at 27bpm — is Martin Brady. But the word is from the Greek "bradys" for "slow", so it's just a coincidence!

* A slower rate of 26bpm is recorded elsewhere, but not certified by Guinness.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@seanreilly There's a huge genetic component. Lower is indeed better (heart is working less hard), as long as you're asymptomatic for bradycardia (i.e. not generally tired, weak, dizzy, fainting).]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Fabriceburtin Sort of. You see a full screen notice that you've reached your limit. You can override for either 15 mins or until end of day. Like all self-improvement, willpower is needed!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@asabaker It is. You're in your thirties or thereabouts? So the average for a man your age would be roughly 70-75. Nigh-bradycardic resting pulse is some combination of genetics, or sustained aerobic exercise (and having the time/lifestyle for that is an affluence signal, also rare!)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[iOS 12 is the Screen Time release for me. I think it's going to have a huge impact on how I use these devices. I'm already setting app and website limits, based largely on dismay at my bad habits.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@fwd4 Nope. That's my actual pulse rate.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JamesFInman I assume that's genetic bradycardia (surely)? This is mostly athletic conditioning. I used to be a lot higher. Took years. 😑]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@dsilverman @wirecutter Not sure where I'd put it! Too wary of spills for bedside (and does it put out RF?), and I wouldn't want it on my desk in the office. Perhaps in the living room, in my wife's bookcase.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Stefan51278 Definitely. It's a much more intentional, percussive, resonant, joyful, evocative experience. I seem to have a psychological response to the bulk of the keyboard, especially in front of the iPad's slim form; it makes the whole thing into a typing machine, not a fancy computer.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Stefan51278 Well, "better" is a vague and subjective word. You'd have to define exactly what properties of the typing experience you'd characterise as being superior. You and I would likely have different preferences, as would others.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@dsilverman Well sure, but there's a substantial difference between the probable behaviour of the average person — indeed, I doubt there'll be a reduction — and what may be beneficial or wise. You certainly _can_ have "too many screens", and too much screen time.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@dsilverman Why have your phone propped up on your desk, though? If you're at work, presumably you're working and shouldn't have your personal phone so prominently displayed. If you're at a desk at home, presumably you have a better device to interact with for the same stuff.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@iancahill Well, my situation is also privileged in that my home is my workplace, and I'm on the iPad full-time so I really don't use my phone during the day. No need to.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@iancahill Fair enough, but I don't think I know anyone with an alarm clock (phones or fitbits do that job now). And how often do you need your phone in the middle of the night? I can think of maybe once in the last three years. Seems a bad thing!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I also think I read that wireless mats charge things much more slowly, and that faster charging requires a higher-wattage mains adapter than the usual little USB plug.
