		<document><![CDATA[In a blog written in 2012 Wings over Scotland blogger, Stu Campbell, blamed Liverpool fans for the 1989 crush which killed 96 people.   He said “every single solitary person who died at Hillsborough was killed by Liverpool fans”, adding: “If nobody pushes,  nobody dies.”]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[I'm not Haggerty's biggest fan but, unlike Wings, she's never blamed the Liverpool fans for what happened at Hillsborough.
