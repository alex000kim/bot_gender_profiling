		<document><![CDATA[@BryanWeaverDC @BenHarris_1 @thelinehotel @UnionMarketDC @erikbruneryang @WhotelDC @FullServiceRDO Of course not. And I'm glad the District and the ANC put the screws to them for it. But as far as I know, they're keeping their end of the bargain.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BenHarris_1 @thelinehotel @UnionMarketDC @erikbruneryang @WhotelDC @FullServiceRDO Sure, Friday and Saturday night are amateur hour... but that's to be expected. But I hope you find another time to go by and experience it, then decide if it's insufferable or not. It's my favorite place in DC by leaps and bounds at the moment.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BenHarris_1 @thelinehotel @UnionMarketDC @erikbruneryang @WhotelDC @FullServiceRDO 85% of its staff are District residents, 50%+ from Ward 1, and they even have a community center reserved for Ward 1 non-profits. When you visit, I think you'll see that it's a dramatically different way to experience DC, as a local or a visitor.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BenHarris_1 @thelinehotel @UnionMarketDC The conversations that happen at The LINE over coffee or @erikbruneryang's food, I assure you do not take place at the @WhotelDC. Every inch of the hotel has local fingerprints, from the food to the 3,000 pieces of art to @FullServiceRDO. Locals have legitimate skin in the game.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BenHarris_1 The 3 restaurants aren't the defining characteristic of @thelinehotel. It's the sense of community it's created — finally, a gathering place that isn't strictly a coffee shop, bar, or restaurant. The LINE is the most culturally significant development in DC since @UnionMarketDC.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BenHarris_1 If you can telecommute, stop by on a weekday, grab an Americano at The Cup, then grab a seat in the lobby, plug in, get work done, and observe the creative collisions and the exchange of ideas happening around you, between locals and visitors who aren't in suits with name tags.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BenHarris_1 Please go, then tell me if you think the same. Not on a Friday or Saturday night (because let's face it, the entirety of DC becomes one big McFadden's for the bridge and tunnel crowd on weekends), but on a Tuesday afternoon or Saturday morning.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@drew_vkamp @cjane87 Don’t get me wrong... DC’s come a loooong way and I’m proud to be a Washingtonian, but I believe the nation’s capital should be its crown jewel.

		<document><![CDATA[@drew_vkamp @cjane87 It’s not that DC is not LA or NY, it’s that it doesn’t think or play on the same level. It’s the nation’s capital, but is culturally insignificant apart from politics.

		<document><![CDATA[@rrhoover @delk @MusaTariq I do believe people intrinsically want to help. But how do you qualify who “deserves” help?
