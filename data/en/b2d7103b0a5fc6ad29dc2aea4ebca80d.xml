		<document><![CDATA[@CloHutch_ @MarketHalls @HotBoxLDN What's funny is that it could get easily missed in favour of some more 'standout' dishes from this and other stalls - but I thought this poutine was just perfect. Melting brisket. Deep smokey sauce. Spicy sriracha. All messy and dirty. What's not to love! 🇨🇦]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MarketHalls @HotBoxLDN I did...and so has my cholesterol! (but totally worth it!)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[So this was my guilty pleasure today (oh, notwithstanding this was already my 4th dish @markethalls!) - Beef brisket poutine with smokey sriracha + bbq sauce from @hotboxldn. Maybe it's my Canadian roots, but this side totally rocked..🇨🇦🎸🎶
