		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean That’s what DH did when he transitioned his job at the hospital to private practice. Went from 5 days, down to 3 days, 2 days then... GONE. 👋🏼 Took about 6 years in total. Could have been faster but we were also busy having babies &amp; that’s a whole other job as you know!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean Except that’s not how you “make” a new job :) It doesn’t have to be so black/white. Don’t quit your job/sell your house. Not so drastic! Just “nudge” in the direction you want “over time”. It will happen in little baby steps. Then you can begin to pull away from your old job.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean No, we couldn’t get anything decent in NOTL on such late notice so we stayed near the Falls. First time the kids have been to the Falls so that works too. We spent most of yesterday &amp; dinner in NOTL &amp; will today too.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@DrBillHowrilla @KellyPediNp Ahhh of course. Now I get it. You’re not actually a real medical doctor nor a psychologist. You have literally zero training in mental health as a DC. Please. Stay in your lane cracking backs &amp; leave the pep talks up to qualified mental healthcare professionals. #CredibilityGone]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DrBillHowrilla @KellyPediNp Are you a full or half wit? Read my bio. I work in health care. With patients who live with disabilities none of which are “self erected”. Unless you think getting your head smashed in by a car is just them being a victim? Save your bizarre disconnected platitudes. Try empathy.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DrBillHowrilla @KellyPediNp I would love to hear you tell someone with a physical or mental disability to just “rise up”. Uh, no bro. It doesn’t work that way. Get down from your high chair &amp; connect with them. Try empathy &amp; support. Not everyone lives in your privilege fishbowl.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DrBillHowrilla @KellyPediNp Education is a privilege. Herein lies the barrier for some. As a healthcare provider, you can’t provide excellent healthcare if you don’t even notice your patients have barriers &amp; understand how to connect with them. Inclusivity requires you to look beyond your vantage point.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DrBillHowrilla @KellyPediNp The problem with auggesting people just ask for help is those who lack privilege don’t even know who to ask or that they should even be asking something in the first place. That takes awareness that something is even missing. They’re no victims, just totally unaware. Know this.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DrBillHowrilla @KellyPediNp Oh dear. Sounds like someone who hasn’t experienced anything but privilege.

		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean Also, men don’t rape because they’re “sexually frustrated” or don’t “get enough”. Men who rape are psychopathic assholes who crave power. A doll probably wouldn’t cut it for them since it can’t express fear/lose power.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean Cum dumpsters? YES.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DrBillHowrilla @KellyPediNp Meaning, not everyone can simply wake up with their cape on, realize that (drumroll please) “they alone are responsible for their health” 💪🏼 &amp; advocate for themselves. To be so empowered/aware/educated/able comes from a place of privilege. It’s not that simple for everyone.]]></document>
