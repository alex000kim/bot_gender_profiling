		<document><![CDATA[Turin's café culture goes back to the 18th century and the House of Savoy. And this is its quentessential pick-me-upper - 'bicerin' - a warm multilayered drink of cream, coffee &amp; chocolate. And there's no shortage of old skool cafés in town to try it..☕

		<document><![CDATA[Turin's association with cars began way before 'The Italian Job', being the centre of the Italian car industry. And the Museo dell'Automobile is a treat not just for petrolheads.
