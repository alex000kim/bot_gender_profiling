		<document><![CDATA[@CianByNature Oh yeah? Nice. Tell him to hit me up if he is haha]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Millar_Colin @JackRathborn Don't think that's the case this time around. Just genuinely think a few of those players aren't up to the standard of a top team]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thehuwdavies I don't think they are in this case. Just think quite a few of them aren't good enough for a top team. Conte's negativity hasn't helped either, but I think he's just been worn out by the incompetence of a directionless board]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@No1isChelsea This is exactly it. The club can't continue with this short-termism. It's sucking the life out of the team]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Chelsea are a leadership club who willingly sack managers, sign bang average players, ignore the best youth academy in the country and have no long-term plan. Why on Earth would Hazard and Courtois extend contracts for that?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@TheBlairNewman It's sickening really. If this Napoli can't win it from Juve, then who can? Worrying]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You can tell by the devastation amongst the Napoli fans in the stadium that they know it too]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Well, that's Juve's 7th title in a row anyway]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@under_thecosh It's why they never win anything]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@CianByNature Proper order. That is despicable behaviour]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Steviegrieve Forgot what an absolutely ludicrous performance that was]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@LiamPaulCanning It's as important as the League Cup imo. In fact, I enjoy the league cup more because it doesn't have the nonsense narrative]]></document>
