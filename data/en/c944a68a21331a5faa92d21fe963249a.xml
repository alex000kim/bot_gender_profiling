		<document><![CDATA[@AAUParentfacts you cannot tell what a kid will do over a 35 game AAU season from just 2 2 hour practices.  We can think it, we can hope but at the end of the day I am guessing most coaches get it right but it is not an exact science.  We all miss.  Sometimes you cut a kid that is really good.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@AAUParentfacts It's hard to know from a 3 hour try out.  And sometimes a kid just doesn't perform to the level of where you thought they would be.  Lot's of intangibles.  Or a kid playing in front of them is just flat out better.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @boggio_ryan @ben_davis113 @BallasTV You named 3 blue bloods.  LOL.  You keep setting the bar and then moving it.  Who has been successful like those teams?   Do you realize their are 347 D1 basketball programs.  You knock him because 3 are better.  Then call him average.  😂😂😂]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @boggio_ryan @ben_davis113 @BallasTV last time... I will say slowly.  His career winning percentage is higher than at least 4 guys you named in your top 10.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @boggio_ryan @ben_davis113 @BallasTV HIS CAREER WINING PERCENTAGE IS HIGHER.....  Take those 4 years out and he still has more sweet 16 appearances.   Geesh.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @boggio_ryan @ben_davis113 @BallasTV Good thing Jay Wright did not lose to UMBC you might call him a bad coach.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @boggio_ryan @ben_davis113 @BallasTV Has Mike Brey ever been to a final four?

So let's see.  Lower career winning percentage, never even been to a final four but somehow he is better.

Bruh, we do..... It was fun though.... catch u later.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@boggio_ryan @TheOracleACHNJ @ben_davis113 @BallasTV Roy Williams has 3 second round losses in last 6 years maybe he is not "slightly above average" either.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@boggio_ryan @TheOracleACHNJ @ben_davis113 @BallasTV Exactly.  Maybe Coach K is only "slight above average"   😂😂😂😂]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @ben_davis113 @boggio_ryan @BallasTV How do you rank coaches?  I know D3 coaches that would win chips at D1 if they had the talent.  You can't just rank coaches.  If you truly understand basketball.

But I would be hard pressed to find 10 coaches with Jay Wrights resume.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @boggio_ryan @ben_davis113 @BallasTV PPl are holding 1st round losses against him like Nova was not the 9 seed in two years and got upset as a 2 seed the other year.  But I guess upsets dont happen to Elite coaches.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @ben_davis113 @boggio_ryan @BallasTV Bruh, I thought he was a hell of a coach when he took Hofstra to the dance.  The man can actually coach.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@boggio_ryan @TheOracleACHNJ @ben_davis113 @BallasTV The reality is, if YOU were lucky enough to get a D1 gig at a non blue blood school and YOU had the exact same career Jay has had.  YOU would be extremely proud of yourself.  He has done what the VAST majority of college coaches have not.  And for some reason u cant see it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@boggio_ryan @TheOracleACHNJ @ben_davis113 @BallasTV no talking sense into this useless debate.  Wright is slightly "above average" and under performing in the 11th game of the season.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @ben_davis113 @boggio_ryan @BallasTV Calipari has 11 years more coaching experience and Jim has like 25 years more experience.  

And even then the chip is not the sole indicator of being a good/great coach.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@all_metelite Good point.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@all_metelite For the top 100 or 150 players I’m betting college coaches would rather deal with HS coaches more so than AAU sneaker team guys.  Nothing is done by accident.  If I’m wrong then it’s another reason but it for sure ain’t a mistake.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@all_metelite It’s not a mistake.   They did it on purpose.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@jwherron10 I think he was borderline (1 &amp; Done).  If he had a strong year and a few big games in tourney then hell yes....  Kids love that jelly fam.  Great marketing.

However, being a 20 yr old freshman, caught in the scandal in AZ and now being uncoachable is hurting him.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ben_davis113 @TheOracleACHNJ @boggio_ryan @BallasTV Tony Bennett is a hell of a coach.  Or are we now on the Tony Bennet can't coach bandwagon?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ben_davis113 @TheOracleACHNJ @boggio_ryan @BallasTV OK.  Agreed.  But I am not getting your point.  His resume speaks for itself.  Not many out there are better.  That cannot be debated.  So what are we in fact debating?  What is a top ten coach?  Who is a top ten coach?  And if his resume is not then whose is?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ben_davis113 @TheOracleACHNJ @boggio_ryan @BallasTV Kevin Ollie was only a head coach for 6 years.  The one group of 4 yr players he recruited never got past 2nd round.  bad comparison.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I have not caught one of his games.  But if this highlight is anything like how he plays night in and night out, then he may need consideration for the number 1 pick. https://t.co/CFuWfgyFDS]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ben_davis113 @TheOracleACHNJ @boggio_ryan @BallasTV For the 1,395th time.  Coaching at NOVA is not the same as Coaching at UNC or Duke.   

U mention 30 win seasons.  He has done that 5 times.  In those 5 he has 2 chips and 3 final four appearances.

U keep saying he went out in first round 5 straight times.  That is not true.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@boggio_ryan @TheOracleACHNJ @ben_davis113 @BallasTV I can't with you now]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @boggio_ryan @ben_davis113 @BallasTV Yeah, they have a tough stretch coming up against Santa Clara, CSU bakersfield and North Alabama]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @boggio_ryan @ben_davis113 @BallasTV Bruh, u just watch bball.  You clearly dont understand it.  Like I said Im not a Jay wright fan but if you take in the beauty of his offense you cant make those types of statements.  The fluidity is amazing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @boggio_ryan @ben_davis113 @BallasTV There you go again.  On your list of 10 coaches at least 5 of them play weaker schedules than NOVA.  You have no standard for your argument.  You are just bored and want attention right now.  U just keep making ish up.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@boggio_ryan @TheOracleACHNJ @ben_davis113 @BallasTV Please we gotta be specific.  he took a senior laden team to the tournament his first year then never had another winning season before getting fired at BC.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @ben_davis113 @boggio_ryan @BallasTV oh, "above average".  Ok.  So the other 300 coaches in D1 who never won a chip or have winning percentages in the low 6's or below are not even good coaches.  SMH.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @ben_davis113 @boggio_ryan @BallasTV Im not a silly fan.  I talk facts and love the game.  The man is clearly a good coach.  im actually playing myself by even debating something so obvious.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @ben_davis113 @boggio_ryan @BallasTV D1 ball is more than just 6 top level coaches.  There are a few hundred programs and jay wright is clearly in the top 10-15 coaches who I would call elite.  based on accomplishment.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @ben_davis113 @boggio_ryan @BallasTV Neither did John Thompson or alot of coaches.  Bruh, you are holding Jay Wright to a unattainable standard.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @boggio_ryan @ben_davis113 @BallasTV He has made sweet 16 and final four before also.  Do you realize how hard it is to accomplish the things he has?  What does glossing over his win percentage mean?  If you win almost 7 out of 10 NCAA D1 games in your career that is a MAJOR accomplishment.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @ben_davis113 @boggio_ryan @BallasTV LOL.  Ok.  Couldnt keep up.  Went to the final four a year before he left for the NBA.  I'm sure that is why OKC hired him cuz he couldn't keep up.  

Nice talking with you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @boggio_ryan @ben_davis113 @BallasTV LOL.  .690 career winning percentage and 2 chips is "average".  Thats actually funny if you think about it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @ben_davis113 @boggio_ryan @BallasTV Yall?  wth.  I love basketball.  Im not even a NOVA fan.  the man can coach his ass off.  And he is in the midst of a great run at a non blue blood school.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @boggio_ryan @ben_davis113 @BallasTV I stand corrected he has a .690 CAREER winning percentage.  So now we are comparing him to elite coaches?  Cal, Williams and Coach K.  That is who you are basing your argument on.  I would agree with you.  They have had better careers.  But that does not make him a bad coach.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BTS_Report WHy do you think it was a stretch?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @ben_davis113 @boggio_ryan @BallasTV And Coach K and Roy were at blue blood schools.  No one is saying Nova is in same category as Duke, Kansas or North Carolina.  Not a fair comparison.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @ben_davis113 @boggio_ryan @BallasTV LMAO.  Jay Wright is not an elite coach?  .720 wining percentage in 23 yrs coaching at the D1 level plus 2 chips and another final four.  

So if his resume is not elite than is he at least decent or good to you?  or he just plain sucks?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TheOracleACHNJ @boggio_ryan @ben_davis113 @BallasTV He was coaching at Hofsta how do you expect him to win a championship there?  Geesh.  And he took them to the dance twice in a row.  How hard can u try to diminsh over 400 wins with a over .720 winning percentage in his career.  The VAST majority of GOOD coaches NEVER win one.]]></document>
