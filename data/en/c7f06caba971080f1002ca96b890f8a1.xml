		<document><![CDATA[@rugbyPhilBB @ImKateMc @simonrug The key to victory imo is high turnout from young voters. I'm confident this can happen as there was presence from the SSM referendum in 2015.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@rugbyPhilBB @simonrug @ImKateMc The answer is it was inserted via referendum in 1983.

		<document><![CDATA[@ImKateMc @simonrug @LdnIrishARC As Kate says @simonrug, this is an enormous vote. It will say a lot about how the electorate is changing.

Context: In 1983 the 8th amendment referendum (banning abortion) was carried 67% to 33%.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rugbyPhilBB @simonrug @ImKateMc It's the way the constitution works. 

If anything I think a public vote gives a lot more validity too it. It's a clear statement from the electorate.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@simonrug @ImKateMc Who makes the rules though? I agree with you but how do you have a fair system.

Tinfoil hat on here, but you don't want to give the state too big a hand in controlling speech.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@simonrug @ImKateMc It's gotten a lot of attention in NI as abortion is still banned there. If Yes passes, NI people could in theory access abortion in ROI.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@simonrug @ImKateMc Fair enough. However either you scrap public funding of parties (no issue there) or you retain. Otherwise you're discriminating. Dangerous territory.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@simonrug @ImKateMc You get into very murky territory policing what political parties say I suspect, even with ridiculous content such as this.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@simonrug @ImKateMc Correct me if I'm wrong @ImKateMc but the undecideds are still significant. Polling companies suggest undecideds generally vote to retain the status quo. Therefore it's going to be close.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@threeredkings @Overthehillprop @Colliniho @ormondlad @KevDolan86 @munster4ever @timoconnorbl I'd rather look at putting a Coombes on the bench. Botha offers the experience in the dirtracker squad.

I'd rather seen him move on and get 15+ starts elsewhere. Of course there's more to this than pure rugby reasons.]]></document>

1. Your political leanings and how they were shaped. 
2. Much political discourse in the US is filled with anger and hatred of the other "side", with no room to  listen and change  minds. Does this reflect everyday discussions you see with others?]]></document>
