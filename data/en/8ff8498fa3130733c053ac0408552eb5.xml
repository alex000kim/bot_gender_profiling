-still checks can partially succeed 🙂]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@taverntalesdm I think for some previous editions, notably 3E, this is a valid criticism. 5E is intentionally fuzzy in some of these areas to keep it friendly to DM adjudication. This, my response to "I don't like X in 5E" is usually "hack it however you like!" 🙂]]></document>
