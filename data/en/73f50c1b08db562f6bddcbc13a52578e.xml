		<document><![CDATA[@realDonaldTrump I bet you and your buddies will be well positioned to profit off the bubble when it bursts, or when our currency devalues bcs of the increase in debt. If you short America, as POTUS, it is TREASON!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@realDonaldTrump Sure does suck they can't deduct the job related expenses like they use to. Job doesn't pay like it should already. Maybe if you had actually read the tax bill, you could have fixed that. But you didn't, bcs you aren't smart enough to comprehend it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@realDonaldTrump @jamiejmcintyre @dcexaminer And there isn't a single thing you can point to that has led to this that has come from you, NOT ONE THING! Not one change by you that has helped. The idiot who says he knows more than the generals. What a damn joke! God, you're an embarrassment!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@realDonaldTrump Stop thinking and talking like a damn business guy, and start acting like a POTUS. It's like you have no grasp of why the USPS loses money. PLEASE start actually learning about issues I could explain to any high school kid. For Pete's sake, you said, trust me]]></document>

You will see those changes, which are causing these shortfalls, were forced on them by the GOP, in a bid to force privatization. Unusual requirements, to say the least.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@ChocChip52 @DovePresents @FiveRights @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It is so sad there are Americans stupid enough to spread ridiculous conspiracy theories. Very embarrassing to hear. I thought that level of stupidity was much more rare than it is. Probably a member of Alex Jones fan club.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TomthunkitsMind Please tell me GOP lawmakers are asking these same questions. If not, WHY NOT? Anyone who thinks if this issue cost them POTUS, that they wouldn't raise holy hell, are beyond help or reasoning. Completely in denial.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@KiethMessinger @DiogenesLamp0 @SweetTea7594 @LouDobbs I bet, after convictions, you will still claim innocence. Like Moore, you will claim fraud. So who cares what you think, tho think may be too strong a word in your case.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@KiethMessinger @DiogenesLamp0 @SweetTea7594 @LouDobbs Typical Republican who defends a traitor, bcs he is one himself. You want your Russian connection normalized, but dream on guy. That isn't how America rolls. LOL😁]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KiethMessinger @DiogenesLamp0 @SweetTea7594 @LouDobbs Why do you say that. I remember Trump commented that those folks wanted Russia there. Sounds like he supported Russian annexation to me, as per agreement for election help given(hacking).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KiethMessinger @DiogenesLamp0 @SweetTea7594 @LouDobbs Again, proof is not released during an ongoing investigation as it may compromise future avenues of inquiry. Is this a difficult concept for you? You can demand all you want, but fed investigations take an ave of around 30 months.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump I got so damn tired of GOP claims of overreach by PBO. The facts never seem to dispell GOP fantasies. It's like facts are just a nuisance to be overcome by yelling FAKE.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@melakatweets @Noname88325524 @sbrunarski59 @SteppyThornton @JohnWDean How many bills did Dems bring to floor, only to have poison pill amendments by the GOP kill them! They held vets hostage by killing every vet help bill Dems tried, said only if ACA or abortion repealed. It made me sick. The GOP party of "NO"!]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@KiethMessinger @DiogenesLamp0 @SweetTea7594 @LouDobbs Other countries didn't get heavily involved with trying to illegally tamper with our election. Cyber attacks are a crime, and Trump welcomed/encouraged said attacks. Remember (Russia, where are HRC emails).]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@KiethMessinger @DiogenesLamp0 @SweetTea7594 @LouDobbs Trump lies daily, depending on the needs of the moment. He also said he had nothing to do with Russia during the campaign, which is a flat out lie. Defending a serial liar does not speak well to your credibility.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@KiethMessinger @DiogenesLamp0 @SweetTea7594 @LouDobbs Shows a pattern of criminal activity in his circle, which he picked himself. Guess you will have to wait for conclusion of investigation to see what proof there is of collusion and/or conspiracy. Releasing proof now could endanger ongoing investigation.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@KiethMessinger @DiogenesLamp0 @SweetTea7594 @LouDobbs And the GOP are just innocent little choir boys and girls. So tired of unproven allegations of fraud that GOP just can't seem to prove, even when they control govt bodies investigating. Isn't that odd?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KiethMessinger @DiogenesLamp0 @SweetTea7594 @LouDobbs Funny how it's like that only if the opposition gets him, don't you think?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@KiethMessinger @DiogenesLamp0 @SweetTea7594 @LouDobbs And defending those who would do America harm is TREASON. Those sanctions are a national security matter. They matter. You probably don't even know why, dipshit.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@KiethMessinger @DiogenesLamp0 @SweetTea7594 @LouDobbs My, but the conspiracy nut Idiocracy is strong with this one. You should consider thinking for a moment before the words come tumbling out. Could save you some embarrassment, sport.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@KiethMessinger @DiogenesLamp0 @SweetTea7594 @LouDobbs He STILL hasn't implemented the sanctions dipshit. Overwhelming bipartisan act he refused to follow up on. Concrete action by ALL of Congress replaced by nothing but Trump's mouth, and we all know that is toothless.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@volksfan2 @Allison59798116 Remember PBO staring down Putin? At least he didn't kiss Putin's butt, and neither did HRC. Putin knew HRC winning would make his plans much tougher, as a STRONG POTUS is a tough obstacle to hurdle. Trump is good for Putin's plans for expansion.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@KiethMessinger @DiogenesLamp0 @SweetTea7594 @LouDobbs Passing stricter ID laws to fix a non existent problem is pretty transparent attempt to restrict voter access. Voting is a right, not a privilege.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KiethMessinger @DiogenesLamp0 @SweetTea7594 @LouDobbs Reminds me of GOP objections to PBO number of executive orders, then mute reaction  or cheering of Trump using them. Hypocrisy abounds.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Tim34867955 One funny thing is, if you raise min, most will be off that assistance. They won't qualify anymore. They don't really gain, but the govt coffers do.

		<document><![CDATA[@Tim34867955 The wealthy have the advantage of making the rules, while the poor must take whatever is allowed them. Not everyone is a superstar, but that shouldn't doom you to deprivation. If you work hard, you should be able to afford the basics.]]></document>
