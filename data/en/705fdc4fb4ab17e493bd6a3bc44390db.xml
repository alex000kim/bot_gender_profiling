Been going to stop at 4 but it occurred to me that though it's #VolunteersWeek we also need to recognise the contribution our partners, including @ChildReporter and Social Work make to the hearing system. If we weren't working together, we wouldnt get the results we need.]]></document>

There's also something like 500 AST members across Scotland. Some are also panel members, some aren't. They all put a lot of time &amp; effort into making the hearing system what it is, helping it take the best possible decisions for children and young people #volunteersweek]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[2.

I've gained vast respect for what panel members do &amp; the commitment they show. It's not just the hearings, critical though they are. It's the preparation &amp; reading, it's the training, before &amp; during being a panel member and it's the values they demonstrate. #volunteersweek]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[1.

As you may have noticed, it's #volunteersweek . I've been a volunteer as an Area Convener with @CHScotland for almost 3 years. Over that time, I've learned a huge amount. I've been stretched, challenged, inspired, humbled and at times just gobsmacked.]]></document>
