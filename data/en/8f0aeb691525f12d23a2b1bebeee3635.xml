		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean I agree with that reality, hence my point. I think we need to be more careful about the actions we take (or don’t) by thinking through the bigger picture &amp; developing a more rigorous policy (including media coverage) before making single and highly publicized moves.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean The major concern lies in the precedent: what happens the next time a teenage girl or adult woman from Saudi Arabia flees her family b/c they believe Canada will take them, does that mean automatic sanctuary?

		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean @dentonmatthew22 Poor woman had employees gossiping about her behind her back &amp; complaining to the managers / being mean/catty while she was going through the death of a parent. People just never know what someone is going though &amp; should not assume “unfairness”.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean @dentonmatthew22 The other piece people don’t realize is because of privacy requirements, it’s not like any manger is going to announce to the team (nor should they) that “Sally’s mom is dying so she needs to take every Friday/weekend off so her husband can be with their kids”. #realstoryfakename]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean @dentonmatthew22 I thought that CBC article missed this perspective, which would have helped the reporting be more balanced in understanding these challenges. Otherwise it fans flames of perceptions of unfairness (some of which may be valid, but most often these limits are with very good reason).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean @dentonmatthew22 Sadly, I have witnessed “backlash” against parents, people caring for elders, even a woman who’s child had cancer for not... “pulling their weight at work”. Mostly from employees with zero responsibilities other than themselves. No empathy, hence the need for acc legislation.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean @dentonmatthew22 Lol. Being in HR means I have multiple employment law certifications &amp; 20-yrs experience navigating employment law issues. Part of the job, yo :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean @dentonmatthew22 Kind of the same reason society has reserved seating on public transit for elderly/pregnant/disabled, priority parking spaces for people with disabilities/parents with small kids, etc. Accommodation recognizes the additional challenges imposed upon certain groups of people.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean @dentonmatthew22 And beyond parents as one example, my point about “accommodation” incorporates anyone with family status needs - elder care/adoption or any other caregiving need. B/c these people are limited to times that factor in people besides just themselves. Way less flexibility.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean @dentonmatthew22 And those who do “look at the school calendar,  realize they taking kids out of school” do so b/c they have inside into the fact that a particular week won’t interrupt their kids learning one bit / take opportunity to save money (see also: privilege). Big picture = not the norm.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean @dentonmatthew22 So wait. If parents pull kids out of school “all the time” then why is anybody even writing this article? Oh right. Because it’s NOT typical. Big picture... the overwhelming majority of parents don’t interrupt their kids education on a regular basis to go on vacation.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dentonmatthew22 The “fairness” (equity) lies in providing everyone in similar situations with the same benefits. So if/when a childless person becomes a parent, the obvious limiting need for long weekends is provided to accommodate their circumstances. Accommodation &gt; preference IMO.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dentonmatthew22 I think the other thing people need to keep in mind is accommodation for family status matters. For example, parents can’t just pull their kids out of school any time for vacation, so it’s limited to long weekends/spring break/summers unfortunately. It kind of is what it is. 🤷🏻‍♀️]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mamaofabean Exactly. And the evidence shows it serves absolutely no effective policing purpose either. Not only is carding a giant waste of tax dollars, it served the OPPOSITE purpose of bringing in a community which already doesn’t trust them (and with good reason). Many levels of dumb here]]></document>
