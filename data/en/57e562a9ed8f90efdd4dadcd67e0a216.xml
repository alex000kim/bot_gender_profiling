		<document><![CDATA[Good morning, home office. https://t.co/G1Z8VgEXOv]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Edenwaith Around the edge.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@fullerc Comes with the desk. Check IKEA to see if it's available separately, but I'm sure there are third-party versions too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@nervousMONSTER Exactly. Got pics?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MalcolmTeas As a writer using iOS, I've had no need for it. That said, I might be tempted by the 12.9" iPad Pro when they presumably update the models next month.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Apple Pencil pot/holder (search Amazon for "samdi"). Bring your own Lightning cable and female-to-female adapter (included with each Pencil), and you can charge it right on the desk. https://t.co/9IcJjFqVsq]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dfreniche I was confused by that for a moment, but I realised. 👍]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@khaled I think it depends on a lot of factors. I chose this desk partly because the legs are adjustable; I keep surface height just below 70cm (I'm short — 5'5"). The Aeron chair is also my biggest purchase for the office (way more than iPad!), and I've had no problems since getting it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@iChris Notice even that the iPad cable has a portion that's just tucked in, not tied — because switching to landscape pulls a couple of extra inches of cable through the stand, so it needs some slack.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@iChris Endless source of fascination for the dog. He's not happy until I come back up; stands guard at the top of the steps/ladder until I do, peering down (too steep for him to traverse).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@alpower The blind behind the desk is usually half to two-thirds down when I'm working, yes. Previously, when the desk was at the side window, I had to rebalance the blinds all through the day as the sun moved.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[(Whisky the puppy says: why are you on the floor under the desk taking photos, dad?) https://t.co/QefIUlqXnq]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Cable management! Desk is IKEA Bekant 140x60cm. Mesh below holds a 4-plug extension. Cables for iPad and Apple Pencil holder (charges), with twists for excess. Cord goes down desk leg, held by trimmed white wire-twists, routed along skirting board and lashed with velcro strips. https://t.co/x0gH5J7Zs0]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@iChris I just play it acoustic. The amp and all the gear is below for when I need it. (Basement is beneath this room; note big trapdoor in front of the printer cabinet, which we've blended as much as possible — hence hook on far wall.)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Sonee_John Popular request, but probably not financially viable just yet. For the future, certainly.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Sonee_John Thank you!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tantramar Currently in a big case in the basement, which coincidentally is below my office. I'm considering some kind of frame for the wall.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Re the Switch station, it's a Billy bookcase (of course). Took the back off because it looks fantastic, letting the wall colour come through and visually lightens it — but the back is a structural element! ⚠️ So I added custom L-shaped supports throughout. Also mounted to wall. https://t.co/iMKVahtCEK]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Sonee_John 99% of the time, yes. I'm a novelist, and I use an external keyboard, and I find it a very useful orientation for writing and editing. It's more page-like.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Here's an example of the printer unit's organisation. There's USB power in the drawers to charge things. Sensor lights above, for when I nip into the office (door is opposite) to quickly get something in the evening and don't want the full (voice, Alexa) lights on. https://t.co/ZF8rLV90DL]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@chrisdejabet Both windows have roller blinds. I have the main one about half down most of the time when I'm working.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@dfreniche I usually take the Switch through to the big TV and Sonos system in the living room; I have a dock through there too. So convenient My wife prefers me to play where she can watch. I just love being able to move it around so easily.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Window. There's another window directly behind the desk, to the right of this pic. https://t.co/XbyxUBzyCl]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[View to right. Stationary bike, pull-up bar for door frame, push-ups handles, free weights. Far corner in the printer/cables nook. Drawers have dividers and are meticulously organised. In-drawer power for charging. Sensor lights when approaching that corner when dark. https://t.co/qpqE1jiO88]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[From the desk. Lots of lovely space. Dog naps beside me. https://t.co/yYRvdZg72S]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Here it is. Desk moved to middle of room, guitar and dog bed rearranged. More of a writer-y, study-like feel. https://t.co/PKfF86cLqi]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Who wants to see some photos of my new home-office layout? Well, tough, because I'm posting them anyway. I'll enjoy it even more now. Here goes!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @EadeDebbie: We need a million from 7 countries to get this considered. People in France, Spain and Italy have signed, too. Come on folk…]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@bigtruck1369 Actually quite easy. Desk only has one outgoing power cable, and everything is pretty light.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@cstromme No, it means that — if a certain number of signatures are obtained; a million overall, plus thresholds in seven EU countries — the EU government will undertake to look into the matter. There's no specific provision as to the practicalities, which is of course a matter for the EU.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Madril Two of the UK's countries voted to remain in the EU. And yes, most recent polls indicate that a different decision would be made today — and the previous referendum was mired in political manipulation, dirty funding, wasn't binding on government, and had a minority turnout.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[EU citizens, please support this initiative by filling in a simple form (it'll take 1 minute). It's important, particularly for those of us in countries like Scotland who face having their EU citizenship stripped away against our wishes. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇪🇺 https://t.co/JsOiITSF8b]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BillySangster Honestly I want a round one in the same colour, because my weird brain has to make sure the edges are parallel to those of the desk.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#AmEditing As a writer, getting back a bunch of edits is somewhat traumatic. The comments like this really help make up for the other 90% that point out my stupid typos and such. https://t.co/XmVfOZF5HE]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@emotionalpedant Ofc. Most of the people I'm likely to find myself in the pub with are scientists of some description, so I have so many opportunities… but my degree is in Comp Sci, so I really screwed myself out of that one. :(]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@emotionalpedant Like I come back to it every four years and think OH GOD IT'S THAT AMAZING MOVIE WHY HAVEN'T I WATCHED IT RECENTLY? Then 1hr later I'm all AH YEAH RIGHT ENOUGH YEAH DAMNIT.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@emotionalpedant Oh god, Sphere. Such a love/hate thing with it. The first 40%-odd is so full of promise that it hurts, then it kind of loses its vibe a bit, and by the end you love it for what you wanted it to be rather than what it is. It needs fixer fanfics. So does the actual book. But, 💜!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@juandesant I forgot there was a web version at all!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@juandesant iOS, though. Not the Mac.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Fellow users of Pages (the Apple iWork word processor thing) on iOS: is there a way to view comments others have made without first having to scroll to find one, or creating a redundant one yourself? The resulting popup lets you flick through them all. I just want to open that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[RT @EUCitizen2017: Thursday brings welcome new endorsements for #PermanentEUCitizenship 
 from Ireland, Italy and UK.

Please sign, share,…]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I'm compelled to wonder how many Americans looked at the alert on their phone and momentarily hoped the orange balloon had finally popped.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@blakecrouch1 (Now I'm trying to come up with a theory as to how the box can physically exist in universes — like Jason/Jason9's — where it was never built, in order to act as an exit there. 🤔)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[My wife recommend @blakecrouch1's DARK MATTER to me, and I read it in a couple of days. It's excellent; kept me hooked all the way through. Sci-fi quantum multiverse thriller that would be perfect for a movie or TV adaption. ★★★★★]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I wonder if @chrisphin has seen this yet… https://t.co/7dIkNc8aQ3]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The very beginning of my love of Nintendo, and my first ever Zelda game. I adore this. Thank you, @chimo55jimbo — it's going up in my office. https://t.co/sXB3HF6VEh]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@marcjenkins So really it depends on what you're upgrading from. Note that Amazon sells refurbished models too, for a little bit less. Whether it's worth the cost is up to you, but it's certainly by far the finest e-reader I've ever seen.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@marcjenkins It is very expensive, but for us it was a massive upgrade (from 6-year old Paperwhites). Bigger and brighter screen, auto brightness, physical (yay) and touch navigation, auto orientation, waterproof (IPX8), and audible support via Bluetooth. It's also a beautifully slim thing.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[And here's my beloved travelling companion (can't find a link to buy it anymore). It's had some DIY repairs, but is still going strong. Grey fabric still looks excellent, and wonderfully scuffed. https://t.co/Qy58T16NUX]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[My iOS 12 Screen Time limits at the moment. #screentime https://t.co/z5Vympgzzx]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Anyone know why the Nintendo Switch Online service only seems to cloud-backup saves at the rate of about one game per day? I know it does it when exiting a game too, but I'd think old/inactive saves would go up a bit quicker than currently.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Achievement(?) unlocked: Mrs G accidentally didn't have her purse with her at our favourite cake shop; "Oh, it's OK; you'll be back at the weekend anyway. Just pay us then." 🍰

(She thinks it's embarrassing. I think it's brilliant — especially since it guarantees weekend cakes!)]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@alstonebridge Yep. I've had one lock screen suggestion today, for a calendar event. That was my first ever.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@drobeson I seem to have internalised that one quickly, even though I also use an iPhone 7 where it's still a swipe up, even in iOS 12.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@alstonebridge Oh absolutely; always a few. They just never appear on the lock screen.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@drobeson Aye. Still, better than pulling down the notifications thing, or swiping to the… whatever the thing with the widgets is.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@civeljahim Logically and linguistically equivalent! We'd say "couldn't care less" to be brusque and rude, and "could care more" to be gently sarcastic. Same meaning, different tone.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@civeljahim I particularly wince at the crazy US expression "I could care less", whereas it's logically "I couldn't care less", as we say here.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@civeljahim We would never say "yes" to mean "go ahead" or "do as you wish" here; it means the opposite, and would be very impolite. We'd instead explicitly say "please do" or similar. Perhaps different in US, where many expressions are butchered into illogicality!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@iChris Well that's a fine perspective indeed.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@civeljahim We'd use it in two different contexts:

1. Asking permission: Do you mind (if I park here)? It means "do you object to this". If you have no objection, answer "no", "not at all", "go ahead"

2. Rhetorically, to express offence. "Do you MIND?! We're having a private conversation!"]]></document>
