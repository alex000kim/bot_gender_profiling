		<document><![CDATA[@Naysayerz @F_Word_FGC @Rob_Morg_Black will have valuable insight here, but as TOs we are more like traditional businesses, just in that space.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@omnigon @DigitalSportUK @DanielMclaren And you know I rate you guys having worked with you previously - this just seems super fuzzy to me as a digital native.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@omnigon @DigitalSportUK @DanielMclaren Why not just list those details though? Seems like it’s a technical framework/CMS, or a methodology of working. Way it’s pitched is fuzzy]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MikeStubbsy Hmmm. This appears to be the weakest brand yet...disappointing given their previous.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DigitalSportUK @DanielMclaren @omnigon It doesn’t actually state what product features Corbine provides though? Sounds quite Marketing fluffy....]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@_Tridd You’d have to have Riot own the finals, but also have TOs apply to run an accredited event as it were. Lots of great starting points!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@_Tridd Good read. Well thought out. If it can be future-proofed to work with any future league concept then it’s a solid choice.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@babyitsmb @JacobNWolf Has that been confirmed?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JacobNWolf But I get your intended point. Almost a sub-brand of the brand.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JacobNWolf Your previous tweet suggested the former. Not trying to be picky, but a lot gets picked up from one line from someone in the know :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JacobNWolf My point is rather that we don’t know if they’ll buy an existing infrastructure and out into new corporation or build from ground up.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JacobNWolf Rather, it could be like MLB and their lower league clubs perhaps?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JacobNWolf Copy of tweet is a little misleading. Dignitas has no relation in naming to 76ers, same as Heat &amp; Misfits. More the relationship.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JacobNWolf You might want to clarify this. Makes it sound like they’ll be buying out an existing org...I.e Immortals etc...]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@Rahul__Uppal @MikeStubbsy I’ll 1v1 you for points.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Rahul__Uppal @Epsilon_Grumpy They know they have limits for how competitive they can be, they just have to work within those constraints.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Rahul__Uppal @Epsilon_Grumpy Another side effect: the less professional teams and the filler ones may fall by wayside. Same with any league - see West Ham for instance.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Rahul__Uppal @Epsilon_Grumpy Let’s not forget that all those teams (Dig, Immortals etc) also have huge VC funds powering them. They’re hardly restricted.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Rahul__Uppal @Epsilon_Grumpy If all the teams were backed by big brands that would be fair, but currently it’s a split.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Epsilon_Grumpy @Rahul__Uppal It’s just they have to make sure they do it authentically. That old buzzword :)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Epsilon_Grumpy @Rahul__Uppal That’s fair to an extent, but in the other side these brands can bring a lot of desperately needed infrastructure and expertise.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Epsilon_Grumpy @Rahul__Uppal Side effect with any high growth product unfortunately. Until a brand steps up and flips the meta like Fnatic it’s challenging.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Epsilon_Grumpy @Rahul__Uppal The Warriors for instance, will be one of the best front offices in the industry. The Cavs, don’t get me started...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Epsilon_Grumpy @Rahul__Uppal Personally think Riot are striking a nice balance between established endemics and non endemics.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Epsilon_Grumpy @Rahul__Uppal What I find laughable is people getting all entitled about teams not being accepted when they often barely have an infrastructure for it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Epsilon_Grumpy @Rahul__Uppal You’d be surprised by who we’ve turned away. Money isn’t everything. As Riot are proving.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[RL excels in its simplicity. LoL has a fanbase. OW? I’m not yet convinced. Amazing fun to play, so difficult to explain to a new viewer.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[League and OWL may be in the same city, but no numbers so far suggest they’d be competing for viewership. Different demos and fan makeup.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Given OWL is highly unlikely to be pulling thousands of LAN spectators (capacity is well below that), I don’t buy the LA piece with IMT.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@AlicusOfficial Definitely not best on a corporate level. Up there but TL, Envy and Fnatic have levelled up considerably. IMT still not staffed properly.]]></document>
