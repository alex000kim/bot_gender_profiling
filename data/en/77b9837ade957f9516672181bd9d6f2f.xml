		<document><![CDATA[Right, I think I’ve finally got to grips with installing python2.something, pip, Django, global vs user and the differences on GNU/Linux vs macOS.

And my zsh config got some significant tweaks along the way to cope.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@0rangelic I’m all kinds of clever with time maths! ;)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[All this typing of `pip` is giving me PDP-11 and CP/M flashbacks. https://t.co/6dpkrbddGX]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[And *now* I discover `easy_install pip` — sure, it’s not like it wasn’t documented somewhere; shame it wasn’t documented via the tutorial I was following though (which did suggest other routes to installing pip).

*fires up an org-mode file to make lots of notes*]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Now we’re getting somewhere! https://t.co/ReSSMkHKMI]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Seems to be a python version issue. Latest Django assumes python3, by the looks of things.

Oh I do love parallel language version issues. :D]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Oh deep joy. :D https://t.co/eOFTZ8DRG7]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I’m sure it’s easy enough to fix (now hard is a sh script in /usr/local/bin, or a symlink, or whatever it takes), but dammit I hate it when step 1 of something needs spit and sticky tape to fix it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Taking a look at Django. Kind of a frustrating start. “First, install pip”. So I do. “Now you can run pip”. Yeah, about that…

zsh: command not found: pip

OTOH `python -m pip` works fine. Got to love tutorials that don’t quite work.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Perhaps I’m missing a trick here, but it seems that the `use-package’ :functions keyword has stopped working, for me anyway. :commands works, but :functions seems not to.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Solved it. Sort of. Still not sure *why* this is required right now: https://t.co/B9ViV8KzDx]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Well this is new. Getting something very odd with the new `use-package` now. https://t.co/sInNfgeTfe]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Discovered in a long-forgotten backwater of some directory on a machine… (and I had to run it in a DOS emulator on my iMac, ‘cos my Windows machine couldn’t handle it). https://t.co/KqzyGMdUnv]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@seanjmoran I hope so! Reading some other background material the other day, I realised how little I knew of the subject.

Once done I might have to go back and re-read all that Dawkins I read 20 years ago. Might make even more sense. ;)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Tidying out some old experimental code. Running VBScript (and JScript) from a Delphi app.

This experiment did end up turning into some deployed code (and supported all sorts of scripting languages in the end). https://t.co/YqmJBQAC7U]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Looks like the use-package change has flowed through the melpa build process. I think I might dare to go back onto the latest use-package again.

		<document><![CDATA[@seanjmoran He did, got it yesterday evening. It looks very useful, especially on the biology side of things (and a little scary there too, in a good way, given it’s something I have almost zero knowledge of).

Really looking forward to working through it all. Deeply appreciate it.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Honestly, I’m really looking forward to the move, to the new challenge, should have done the “leave” thing. But it’s choice-avoiding language like that that really irks me.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Soon-to-be-ex-employer: You know all that stuff you did to hand over development tools/knowledge last week? Can you do it all again because…. reasons.

Also a bit annoyed by “After you leave”. “Leave”. I dunno, “leave” implies something other than “made redundant”.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Looks like it’s this: https://t.co/L5M9FFmTvs]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Hmm. Just did a package upgrade in GNU Emacs and now this. Given `use-package` drives everything about my config, this is a slight concern.

Something to do with `up-core`, I think. Whatever that is. https://t.co/1V5ihe7DKc]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Well this just got interesting. Using https://t.co/5CQIHkOkvV I can have GNU Emacs, in the Linux subsystem, run in X/graphical mode on my Windows desktop.

Which is really nice. https://t.co/NpxXdoYYqD]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Spent a bit of time this morning tweaking the Linux subsystem thingy on my Win10 laptop. Now all zsh and latest Emacs and stuff. Which is nice. https://t.co/wwh9IJDM8C]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Strange experience: after almost a 1/4 of a century of using GNU/Linux I'm now in a position of needing to ask a third party to install stuff. Quite rightly so; I'm no sysadmin and I really don't want to fubar the couple of boxen where this is the case.

Still an odd feeling.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Survived my first day on the new job. Two things stand out:

1) Passwords need to die. The world needs something far better than passwords.

2) I really don't like Outlook.
