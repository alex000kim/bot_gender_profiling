		<document><![CDATA[@DrGilluley @NHS_ELFT @DrAmarShah @baggybinny 5/5
With ur current system, it seems the options are:

~we have to take days off school/work to be involved (attending a monthly meeting = 12 days leave)

~ur engagement is mostly with people who don’t work/attend school 

Or, maybe we generate a range of other options together?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DrGilluley @NHS_ELFT @DrAmarShah @baggybinny 4/5
I fully support ur focus on engagement &amp; also including people in #qualityimprovement 

Maybe the majority of people engaged with the Trust are not working &amp; have free time during the week., but surely ur missing a trick by not fully engaging with everybody #whatmatterstoyou]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DrGilluley @NHS_ELFT @DrAmarShah @baggybinny 3/5
Getting back to work is a key indicator of #recovery

The #CAMHS team echoed this, saying they have 2take days off school for treatment, which is necessary
But now they’re engaged with the Trust they’re asked 2take days off school 2attend engagement meetings &amp;staff interviews]]></document>

Ive seen many engagement events @NHS_ELFT have advertised but they’ve all been M-F 9-5

However, unless I take a day off work, Im unable to attend your meetings

Im sure Im not the first person 2raise this @baggybinny]]></document>
