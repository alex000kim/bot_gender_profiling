		<document><![CDATA[@autumnbreezed This makes me sad. But I can relate. 💕]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JenuinePanic @autumnbreezed You may read this novel so I don’t want to give away any spoilers. All I’ll say is that it’s not a plot device or because Stephenson is trying to empower anyone. It also happens “off-page”. It’s subtly referenced, not described.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JenuinePanic @autumnbreezed @keithoconor I was not a fan of RP1. Less about the pastiche to what was also my childhood (Cline is five years older than me) but more about the juvenile themes of “getting the girl” etc.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@autumnbreezed @JenuinePanic @keithoconor I have read both. The tone and delivery couldn’t be more different. Also, any novel whose main character is called Hiro Protagonist is okay in my book ;)]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@autumnbreezed @JenuinePanic Another one of my favourites. Though my wife actually prefers Stephenson’s The Diamond Age to it. Which, admittedly, is more steampunk than cyberpunk.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@DonH1981 I admire you standing by your newfound principles.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DonH1981 You need a comma when adding detail. “The runner, Don, won the race.” Note the pause. You can remove the commas (and Don) completely and the sentence makes sense. In this case the comma is not needed as Director is his title; it doesn’t add context.]]></document>
