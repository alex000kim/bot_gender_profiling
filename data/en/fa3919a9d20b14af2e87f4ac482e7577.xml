If your aim really is to get Tories out, only logical choices are (1) only campaign in Tory seats in Scotland, or (2) abandon all Scotland to SNP.
Opposing SNP makes no sense.
Unless Tories aren't your real target, of course.]]></document>

1. You don't want to even try for an s30, JFDI, and
2.  You want to start now.
Is that a fair comment?]]></document>
