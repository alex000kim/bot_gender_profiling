		<document><![CDATA[Quite like this stock wallpaper on the new iPad Pro. https://t.co/essFKayi8M]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I use GoodNotes for planning novels, and I also write a letter to my wife each morning when she's travelling on business (like this week), sending it via email. Today's letter was the first with the new iPad and Apple Pencil, and easy switching to the eraser is HUGELY useful. https://t.co/4I3yfgPmlq]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I did see the folding phone, and it perfectly illustrated the problem with the idea: you've got a lovely little mini-tablet thing, and it folds to be even more portable, and everything is great… but then it turns into the ugliest, thickest, stubbiest little phone ever.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I watched the Samsung keynote, and learned that I'm very uncomfortable watching people from other companies transparently mimicking the Jobs/Apple style of presentation. Language, cadence, message… all feels like a knock-off. It's better than Middle-Aged Men In Suits, but hrmm.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Mic drop; debate ended forever. https://t.co/ASWaRzgSur]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DjAtkins Yes, I finally had a go yesterday, and it's so like WoW. From the character choice screen to the bloody mailbox outside the first inn. I know my wife and I are going to play far too much of it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@bigtruck1369 @wasdkeyboards Yes and yes. Freely adjustable through pretty much horizontal to vertical.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@imthaz I noticed that. I never had to replace the nib on my previous one, but it'd be nice to have.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@erynofwales CHAK, it says. It's definitely CHAK.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@awk 😁]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Also, the double-tap action is fab. Really light, and you can do it anywhere in the frontmost third of the Pencil, excluding the nib, and on any area around its circumference. It's lovely and gentle on the fingers, but I doubt you could do it accidentally while adjusting grip. https://t.co/JGB5TFrrHP]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Two things about the new Pencil with the iPad Pro. First, the magnetic coupling is REALLY positive (ha ha). It just grabs the thing. Easy enough to peel back off, but there's no question that the iPad has got a grip of the Pencil. https://t.co/4oS6hxVHXy]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@awk Nope, it's a strat!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@umar_ali Thanks!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DaveGomez @wasdkeyboards Thank you. Me too!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@chrisdejabet Well you know it's 30% de-stressing and 70% making people jealous.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Here's the new panel in Settings for the Apple Pencil 2. https://t.co/Ivvidcl1Fi]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@imthaz @wasdkeyboards No regrets about the 12.9 here. Big and stunning, but not unwieldy.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@darylbaxter @wasdkeyboards Realised I didn't move it around much, and could use extra space for working with outlines, sketches/plans, mind maps, and book cover work. Also it's smaller than the previous 12.9, so less compromise.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@chrisdomico Looks same as back to me.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Oh, and the new Pencil! It's… a Pencil, in a wee box. The iPad shows an adjacent, rotating life-size overlay of the Pencil when you first attach it.

Flat side always goes towards iPad, but you can have the tip either up or down. Magnets are SECURE. Like, pull-iPad-over secure. https://t.co/0yZWhkfzrN]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@darylbaxter @wasdkeyboards I think the 11" will be the right model for most people.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Case makers in China seem to have been caught out by the new iPad Pro's Pencil integration. They all have cutouts for the magnetic port itself, but not for the Pencil's body around it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@RevellWriting Going to try it in the Apple Store first.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@wookiee Absolutely! My fave part. Working on the paperback masters at the moment.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Black_Kettle I did see those (you linked me there before, or am I making that up?) but they're low resolution. Need actual originals.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Anyone uploaded the full-size new wallpapers from the MacBook Air yet? They look gorgeous.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@IanMulvany Thanks very much! It's nice to hear that. 🙂]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mcphat @wasdkeyboards 👌😌]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Thanks for telling me; that IS exciting news. https://t.co/anR30SWikl]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jordanborth I don't think iOS is designed with an abstract cursor in mind. I really don't miss a desk-level pointing device.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@RothParsons @wasdkeyboards Eject, which toggles the software keyboard on iOS.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DonaldHeering 👍 Enjoy!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Edenwaith @wasdkeyboards Powered too. Apple's usb-c HDMI and usb-a adapter.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@drobeson It has a romantic quality, but jeez, life's tough enough without this too. 😞]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Harviej Decaf!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@roryprior I have blinds there that I adjust during the day. They're hard to see in the photo. I rolled them up for better light when taking pics of the iPad.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@frosty Pretend.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ppetrovski I use my Kindle for that, but I edit and proof-read my own work on the iPad, of course.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@breakthesystem Never. Once every few months, I'll have some piece of mail to deal with, but I do that the same day then recycle it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DigDoug I've never really been bothered by those. I'd prefer better photos to a flat back.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Whisky the pup is massively excited about the iPad Pro, clearly, and in no way just wants me to sit back down so he can snooze. https://t.co/Mnpe4mySWG]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Check that gorgeous edge. You can see the Pencil mag/pair/charge panel further down, albeit out of focus. This is the space grey iPad. https://t.co/YHdrnUWhj9]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Naturally I have to show you my home office setup now. Gorgeous big mechanical keyboard from @wasdkeyboards (CHOK CHOK CHOK), connected via Apple USB-C adapter. I keep the iPad in portrait orientation because it's page-like for writing. Aeron chair. Lamicall iPad stand. https://t.co/BZgd7E8qSF]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Here's the new 12.9" with my existing 10.5", to give an idea of the size different. It looks huge here, but in real life the 12.9 really doesn't feel cumbersomely big. https://t.co/NuIZGVtXTL]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Heeey who wants to see some pics of the new iPad Pro 12.9"? You? And _you_?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ladywhimsy @wasdkeyboards Remember that those keyboards use standard Cherry MX switches, so you can order replacement keycaps from pretty much anywhere, at any time.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ladywhimsy @wasdkeyboards Yes. Each keyboard (and each set of caps) includes a wire keycap puller. It's very easy to do, though a few keys (space, right shift, return, backspace) are slightly more fiddly. Still easy! Videos on the wasd support site.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@arnisvanur @alpower This is a 256GB wifi space grey 12.9" model.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@chrisdejabet @1Password It's so, so much easier than before with 1Password and the iOS 12 integration, aye. Still takes a while with all the apps!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[When you use the Share popover on iOS and choose (e.g.) Messages, it'd be nice to have a quick-access display of most commonly chosen recipients, instead of always having to type/autocomplete. About 95% of my messages go to my wife.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Obviously love the reading material, but that cup is excellent too. Coaster is virtually identical to mine here. https://t.co/6Zu7WSwdPB]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@alexcreid Thank you so much, Alex — hope you enjoy it right to the end! Next one in the series is out on December 5th. 👍 (As you may already know since I just won't shut up about it here…)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@martynpie I can't afford to upgrade every year (or two) generally, so it just means our roles will be reversed at some point!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[iPad excitement notwithstanding, it's been a tough few days. Mrs G is travelling for work, and I sleep really badly when she's not here. I can tolerate it immeasurably better since we added this chap to the family, though. Thanks for keeping me company, best pal. https://t.co/xAZ44tiwb6]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@chrisdejabet Think of the number of bloody apps I have to log into now.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@martynpie 😢]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ladywhimsy @wasdkeyboards Excellent. Got plans for customising your keycaps?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@alpower 12.9 indeed. It's a beast.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ladywhimsy YES! Pics when you have it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@OliverJHaslam Ah, congrats. Hope you enjoy the new gear.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@OliverJHaslam At least they're DHL now. That's who brought mine too.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Hey who left this here? https://t.co/jPg2CoDCXd]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@laurengemmell The most beautiful.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@breakthesystem I shifted my desk not long ago, just to try it. I'll probably face the window in my next place.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@david_hewson @ulyssesapp Thank you!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[It was only a matter of time until I wrote a paean to mechanical keyboards. Beloved site members❤️, that's what's coming your way on Monday morning.

❤️ https://t.co/ky1iKsvfpd]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I should make it clear that the dog will be napping beside me on the couch in either of these scenarios. He'll also likely watch me play Diablo for ten minutes or so first, if that's what I choose to do.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@chrisdejabet I mean, I fell asleep for 25 mins on the bed earlier this afternoon and woke up with the dog lying along my side, still fast sleep.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Haven't slept well the last two nights (working late, wife is away, dog scared of fireworks), so I'm a bit tired. After dinner in a while, do I: 

1. Finally try out Diablo III
2. Nap on couch with dog]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@four_sides UK General Elections still use FPTP, but our own Scottish local council elections are STV PR, and our parliamentary elections are AMS-type PR ("MMP"). I do believe that the Scottish systems work effectively, but nothing is perfect.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@four_sides Tough question. To be necessarily brief, I believe in the core idea of PR absolutely, but I acknowledge the practical barriers it can sometimes impose create to decision making. Scotland uses a hybrid system incorporating both FPTP and PR at various levels.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@brunoscheele Still Octopath! Had virtually no time to play lately though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@brunoscheele Almost never use any, but I have wired Bose ones I love.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Well it's not like they'd have stopped for a visit.

		<document><![CDATA[@crumpy You jest, but the planning is in (occasional) progress!

Also I am so tired.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Afternoon decaf break ☕. Ask Me Anything, if you like. 🤔]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@rossmcalli So I hear.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@shawnblanc @ulyssesapp Thanks, mate. 😊 Big milestone. Now let's plan to do it all over again… 🤪]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@imthaz @ulyssesapp Enjoy, and thank you! I'll never forget those words.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[One month until my new novel is out. Written and edited entirely in @ulyssesapp on an #ipadpro. #amwriting #amediting https://t.co/VgaBuv1N83]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Great, but now make one where the ports are on the _back_. https://t.co/0rjgEg0mA5]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@mattbirchler @darylbaxter That looks pretty nice to me.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Hi, I'm a tech journalist who annually reviews whether the iPad is a proper computer yet!

You may remember me from: vague and suspicious use of the word "professional", having forgotten what it was like to switch from Windows to Mac, and not using an iPad as my proper computer.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I looked at the alert tones store on iTunes for the first time, and literally could categorise every single one by the reason I'd hate the person who used it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@darylbaxter Nope. Just… keep it clear. A quiet place to think, instead of the kind of master control status board thing that Android wants us to think we need.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@darylbaxter Or think outside the box and go for _fewer_ icons.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gembarrett Not in the official camera app, at least. I heard it was a safety thing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@alpower Seen the original, but the colourisation is new to me. 😊]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@steviebuzz @chrismiller Seems distinctly likely, given the number of hours I've spent playing WoW with him over the years…]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gjust67 @laurengemmell Unfortunately also the day of terror for the dog. 🤫]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@gjust67 @laurengemmell Thanks mate! See you at the weekend.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@nwreg Chocolate!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Which is ideal because I haven't played Diablo III on the Switch yet. Or on any platform, ever. This will literally be my first time playing it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The thing about this is that it's both a treat and an instruction — she _loves_ it when I chill out and play videogames. It's actively encouraged. 💜]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Wonderm00n 😊]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Wife is on a business trip; took her to the airport this morning. This arrived for me this afternoon from her. 😁💜 https://t.co/SSryId7YH0]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@sajinseethi It's not ideal, but it's lot better than having to use Apple's Reminders app. I think it's one of the ugliest, weirdest apps on the system.]]></document>
