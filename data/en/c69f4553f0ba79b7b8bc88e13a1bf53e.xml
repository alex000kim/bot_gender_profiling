		<document><![CDATA[@Olivefarmer @cutlerstom @PAN_UK Min-chem rather than no-chem yes. But will still make a HUGE difference. We’re working with organic farms too...it really depends on the farmers what approach they eat to take but we’re hoping to make it much easier to be nature friendly. @NFFNUK all the way!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Olivefarmer @cutlerstom @PAN_UK There is some stand alone weeding yes but mainly horticulture (eg Naio). There isn’t anyone else doing a system on the scale we’re working on, &amp; not yet any autonomous weeding for arables.

		<document><![CDATA[@cutlerstom @Olivefarmer @PAN_UK We’re going for funding at the moment and that would indeed be appreciated! We want a good spread of backers who have a vested interest in ensuring this happens (there will doubtless be a contingent who would rather it didn’t!)]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@cutlerstom @Olivefarmer @PAN_UK We’re hoping to make such debate academic- we’re working on non-chemical weeding, and spot applications for other treatments: and only on the individual plant required, rather than the whole field.
