		<document><![CDATA[Due credit to @GOVUK for the very straightforward online passport renewal process, including accepting an iPhone photo. Took just a few minutes, from home, and I dropped off my old passport at the post office while walking the dog afterwards.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@_geraint To me, at least two things here:
1. Re Labour, a profound crisis in confidence amongst party members regarding their leadership.
2. Re SNP, an increasingly politicised swelling of alienation in Scotland from the distant and unaligned UK govt.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Stunning. The SNP — of which I'm a member — is a Scottish party (2017 population estimate: 5.5m), and the Tories are UK-wide (66m, including Scotland).

Also bear in mind that Tory membership numbers are widely suspected to be somewhat, um, what's the word? Optimistic? https://t.co/Q6PWPBRJGX]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@sammynickalls Just to check… you'd normally say "good evening" (even in farewell) at that sort of time, wouldn't you? That's what we'd say here. It's slightly late for "good afternoon". Though the idea of going to sleep at 5 pm sounds wonderful.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@mattcassinelli I can move my morning routine around a bit — the dog doesn't really need me until 11AM or so (wife takes him out), but it'd just result in me missing the chance to have breakfast with my wife before she leaves for work, and I really don't want that to happen.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[A lot of nascent writers doubt that they qualify for the title. I contend that, in fact, you can't claim to be a writer without automatically also being one. Even if you think you're lying, you just made up a story about someone, thus trivially verifying your claim. #amwriting 🤔]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[RT @EUCitizen2017: #PermanentEUCitizenship 
Welcome new endorsements from Bulgaria, Finland, Germany, Poland and UK bring us close to 57,00…]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If people _do_ do that, they're strange in the head, and should similarly be avoided — in the pub and online. You're probably a moderately OK-in-the-head person, however, and you absolutely get to choose what you see and do on social media. You have permission. That is all. 🥃]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I mean, nobody goes to the pub to order a drink and listen for the most obnoxious bastard in the place, then go and join his table for the sake of "hearing both sides", or "impartiality". Nobody does that. To start a fight, maybe; sure. But not to socialise.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[People say you should break out of the filter bubble, and be exposed to other viewpoints. This is an obvious thing. But there's a time and place for that — say, in your news consumption, or long-form reading material, or whatever. Take your pick. Probably not the pub, though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Once in a while, someone will legit email me and ask why I blocked them. And I'll send a polite and generic reply, because _I have no idea_. I don't keep a RECORD OF MISDEEDS, like some kind of nutter. I just block, and go. 💁‍♀️ Zap! Gone from my brainspace. It's just the pub.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Sure, some people use social media like it's a news source, or a marketing platform, or a publishing medium, or a hundred other things. That's fine. But you get to choose what you use it for, and you get to delete everyone who doesn't fit that model from your brainspace forever.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Then there are the people who are a Bad Time. Offensive, or annoying, or… just anything at all that you don't like, at any level, for any reason. It's just the pub! You get to choose, as capriciously as you want. You mute them, or even block them, and forget all about it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[There are also people at the pub who I don't like so much, but need to basically get along with. Those are the people you don't follow here, but might reply to. Or maybe you'd follow but mute, for the sake of appearances. There are real-life analogues, and they're valid.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Here's the thing, right: this is social media. It's a contemporary, online way to socialise. You get to choose who you socialise with just as you would offline, in person. At the pub, say, I'd socialise with those whose company I enjoy. That's who you follow and talk to here.]]></document>
