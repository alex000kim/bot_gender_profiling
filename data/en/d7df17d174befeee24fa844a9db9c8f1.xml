		<document><![CDATA[@JuiceboxCA @instagram The latency does feel excessive, but really — what’s so time sensitive? IMO real-time is overrated, with the exception of Twitter.

		<document><![CDATA[@tomfgoodwin @PaulRogers73 As do I. But you don’t think the cacaphony of voices demanding action, even if “vague,” won’t inspire action? We’re dealing with deeply systemic issues — if protesting inspires one “adult” to reconsider their stance or introduce new policy, that’s a win. Again, one of many steps.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tomfgoodwin An action of this scale forces a conversation being avoided by our country. Even if it causes people to ask, “What‘s the point of marching,” across the dinner table (or on Twitter), it’s shining a light on an issue and it’s all incremental progress.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tomfgoodwin I agree it’s easier to rally people FOR something than against something. Why I’ve eliminated the word “resist” from my vocab — it’s reactive, defensive, divisive. However, I disagree on a need for specificity at this moment. This is a first step of many.

https://t.co/n8MmFJnD16]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tomfgoodwin Huh? It’s literally people who otherwise may not have done anything, now doing something that could directly impact policy change. https://t.co/szhb67kGXx]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tomfgoodwin @womensmarch Ask @spanberger @LUnderwood630 @ErinForYall @DocTran2018 if the @womensmarch accomplished anything.

“Roughly 900 women contacted @emilyslist... about running for office from 2015 to 2016; since President Trump’s election, 26k+ women have reached out about launching a campaign. https://t.co/a9OBdkRLOA]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[If this isn’t action, I don’t know what is.

“There is an unprecedented surge of first-time female candidates, overwhelmingly Democratic, running for offices big and small, from the U.S. Senate and state legislatures to local school boards.” https://t.co/CfAo20G97H]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Protest and civil disobedience raise mass awarenes, give people a sense of voice, and inspire action. Sure, 90% of people at the @womensmarch patted themselves on the back, went home, and got back on Facebook, but it was a seminal moment that galvanized the other 10% into action.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[You’re missing the point. Easy to dismiss some people on TV in Florida. Harder to dismiss droves of people in your backyard. Your assertion assumes that protest is the only element of activism — it’s one of many tools, just like TV ads aren’t the only tactic in marketing. https://t.co/UB36Mud8Xo]]></document>
