		<document><![CDATA[@kejsarmakten @molekuleair The air was “heavy and itchy” which is maybe a better word to describe my experience. Irritating. Dry eyes &amp; throat. I’m asthmatic, so sensitive to it all. Both HEPA filters and opening windows helped. Unfortunately, Molekule did not. Both from personal symptoms &amp; AQ testing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kejsarmakten @molekuleair Also, the air quality sensors we used showed increased levels of particulate (in ppb), so there was definitely SOMETHING in the air besides a lack of oxygen. The HEPA filters cleaned it up no problem &amp; left a fresher smell behind. For $1200, I would expect even better performance]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kejsarmakten @molekuleair I didn’t know carbondioxide smells like musty basement. Opening up window in the winter when it’s -20 degrees out is ideally what I am hoping to avoid. Obviously we live in different climates!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@molekuleair @kejsarmakten If the air was “completely purified” shouldn’t it SMELL completely purified? I expected Swiss mountaintop fresh air. Instead I got musty basement stuffy air with your purifier running full blast all night long. That just doesn’t pass the sniff test for me (pardon the pun).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@molekuleair @kejsarmakten Any reason why you won’t consider independent testing through more well-known and reputable sources like @ConsumerReports? For a $1200 air purifier, it should be made as easy as possible for your customers to be crystal clear on the transparent value of your product.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@molekuleair @kejsarmakten If your unit can’t also mechanically filter larger particles (which seems strange that it somehow picks up small particles but not larger ones) then what are consumer AQI sensors picking up that Molekule can’t get seem to get rid of the way a HEPA filter can?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@kejsarmakten @molekuleair It does for us during the spring, in which case a purifier is helpful, but not the rest of the year. Our tests happened in the past month.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@molekuleair @kejsarmakten If your purifier can not, at least, impact what a hepa filter can, then essentially it does not appear to be moving enough air. From my own experience, the Molekule left our air unfresh. Only an opened window helped until we got a different purifier.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@molekuleair @kejsarmakten That’s interesting. Opening a window seemed to be the easiest way to improve air quality. This was certainly consistent with our tests. I still don’t understand why your unit does not appear to clean what a HEPA filter can. Shouldn’t it do both?]]></document>
