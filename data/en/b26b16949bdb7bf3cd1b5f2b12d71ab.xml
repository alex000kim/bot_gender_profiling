		<document><![CDATA[So the inevitable result of Janus, RtW laws, governors attacking union rights is more strikes. Take away the political route and workers will be left with the industrial one. It’s already happening in WV, OK, elsewhere. It’s not about salaries, it’s about having a voice (end).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Bosses will be willing to spend much more than cost of settling a contract to fight unionization because it’s about power, not money, and the power to set conditions unilaterally. You can’t put a figure on fairness.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Second, for politicians, union rights aren’t just about money. Public workers are like other workers. They want fairness, they want to not be subjected to arbitrary whims of bosses, they want a say in what they do for 8+ hours a day.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[By abrogating right to strike, unions have to rely on politics, and the Democratic Party, to get what they want. As I argue, this makes union rights a partisan issue and makes unions a fat target for the GOP https://t.co/itKLk1wl8i]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[First for unions, CB laws are double edged sword. They establish rights but also constrain unions, which effectively must abrogate right to strike. Unions give up an important tool of leverage, which got them the CB laws in first place.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Republican governors like Scott Walker sell their attacks on public sector unions, which are obviously motivated by politics, as motivated by budgetary concerns. Smash unions, save taxpayer money. Also false.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[This is one of the key arguments of the #Janus plaintiffs. During oral arguments, Anthony Kennedy’s comments indicated he believes weakening public sector unions is an intrinsic good because unions bloat the size of government, which is false.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[However the findings more directly contradict conservative anti-union narrative: that public sector unions expand the size of bureaucracy and increase their own capture of public resources at taxpayer expense. https://t.co/m8K9JOYVF1]]></document>

This resulted in the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act which established family reunification, not nationality (as proxy for race), as underlying principle for US immigration policy.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Why does Trump care so much about a hotel he doesn’t even own? First, the Panama hotel is a money printing machine: it’s earned him “at least $50 million on the project on virtually zero investment” https://t.co/Tb623vYTKb]]></document>
