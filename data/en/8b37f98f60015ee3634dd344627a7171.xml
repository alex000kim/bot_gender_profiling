PS: Emacs over vi. :-P

		<document><![CDATA[Interview number 2 all done with. Heading home again. Was interesting hearing something about the issues they face; also interesting to hear that ruby/rails can still throw up interesting scalability hurdles.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@CostaCoffee Thanks for replying. Sounds like a good plan. Is it making a noticeable difference?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[That's two different @CostaCoffee I've been into in a week, where the napkins were no longer with all the other "extras". Had to request them at the counter. Suddenly being rationed?]]></document>

It was nice to meet a fellow GNU Emacs user, amongst other things. :)]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@trellosupport Good call. I'd not realised, or had forgotten, that was a power-up. I'll be sure to play with and report this properly soon (sorry, busy few days).]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[After more watching/reading, have to admit that teenage me was a twit for dismissing biology for just being “icky chemistry” and having nothing to do with it.

Doesn't seem quite right to me now. 😏]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@seanjmoran Amusingly @0rangelic sent me that link earlier this morning; sat in a tab waiting for me to read right now. :)

Also, once again, thanks for all the links on this subject. I’ve being working my way thought them and have learnt a hell of a lot from them.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Just had to open a childproof lid off some medication for @0rangelic - because that's how my life is now.

She also just tried to use a @TunnockOfficial Tea Cake as a SpaceNavigator (3D mouse).

This is a vicious cold she's got...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Back from a second viewing of The Last Jedi. I think I enjoyed it even more this time. Mostly for reasons I won't mention, because spoilers.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Today I've being learning about prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Yes, I am sort of going backwards at the moment, but this is filling in a lot of understanding.

Can you tell I dropped biology at school? (although this is reminding me how much chemistry I've forgotten too).]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@jwiegley Frustratingly, I can’t recreate this with a very minimal setup. I’m going to need to either try and narrow down what’s causing this in my full config, or try and build up the minimal one until I hit the issue (unless anything obvious stands out to you?).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@jwiegley Still seem to be seeing the same problem. If I use :functions, when I compile, I get a “might be undefined” warning. If I use :commands, I don’t.

When I get a moment I’ll try this with a clean setup and see if I can create an isolated example, make sure it’s not my setup. https://t.co/rvCteSnFci]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[How this didn’t end up with negative sins, I don’t know. Every Alan Tyduk line and the last Vader scene alone should have managed that. And not -50 for “Are you kidding me, I’m blind”? An actual Cinema Sins I disagree with, which is rare.

		<document><![CDATA[@igor_chubin Okay, so it is the total of the given currencies, converted into the “base” currency? Excellent, makes sense now. Thanks.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@igor_chubin I should point out at this point that I know pretty much nothing about the likes of Bitcoin, etc, so I’m coming at this from a position of deep ignorance (rate-sx.el only happened ‘cos I like fun little projects).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@igor_chubin Looking at this this morning, I’m not quite sure what that URL really means. Is it taking the value of 1 BTC and 1 ETH and showing the resulting total in GBP? So, eg, https://t.co/vUDetm6pxS would be “I have 0.1 BTC and 23 ETH, how much am I worth?” sort of thing?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@igor_chubin Ahh hah! I think I see what you mean. At a quick glance I think it should be doable. I'm hoping to extend rate-sx.el next week, when I get some time, so I'll look at this. (want to add support for &lt;cur&gt;.rate.sx switching, at the very least).]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@igor_chubin I think I might be misunderstanding the question. Convert? All my package does is just grab the output of rate.sx and display it in a buffer.]]></document>
