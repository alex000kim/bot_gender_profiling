		<document><![CDATA[@Humean I don't think he's applied as a critical reference point to male artists in the same way although equivalently iconic. So I won't. But good point.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@carriganinetom Yes I know all this. It still doesn't address my initial point of sarcasm. I'll send you my 10,000 word reply once I've written it.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ChrisOlley1 I don't think I'd have asked the question if it didn't at least appear to? I meant the equivalent of the way KB is used as a reference point as opposed to musical similarity. It was a sarcastic comment that probably needs 10,000 words of extrapolation ðŸŒµ]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@carriganinetom That is not the point I was making.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@carriganinetom Thank you. And is Kate Bush widely used as both a benchmark nod to talent/subtle rebuff of male artistic originality. No. Iconic creativity surely should then apply to all genders in reference as not just about female voice?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@carriganinetom Okay let's rephrase it. Which male icon would you see as being equivalent in creative terms to KB?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@carriganinetom I'm not disputing she's an icon. I also know all the other female shorthand reference points. Give me your male equivalent list was the question.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@LoneLadyHQ I think it's the sheer universality of the Kate Bush thing that really gets me. I've just realised mind you that I'm perhaps a total hypocrite as have just written about a female artist &amp; referenced the references to Liz Fraser...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@LoneLadyHQ That actually made me laugh out loud.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@thriftonaut I'm going to have to think about that one]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@clairemaw70 *Woman who has orange and blue tonsils* Critics "almost Kate Bush like in her approach to dancing"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@tobytram I think perhaps they actually mean that one woman of unfettered creativity is all they can handle.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@ChrisOlley1 That isn't really my point tbh. I'm not disputing that KB is iconic or indeed one of a kind.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@humol62 Speaking for yourself only obviously]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@LoneLadyHQ Thanks for this. I get the need for flexibility but don't see why they can't issue best case scenario times in advance on proviso subject to change, other than like you say maximising the turn up. Cheers!]]></document>
