1) one of greatest soundtracks of all time
2) top opening scene maybe of any urban movie if not all movies to me
3) realistic plot (for the most part)

		<document><![CDATA[@CoachSJMiles @CoachSherm5 @vettepassby35 Yall r changing the convo....  Jordan and Kobe won titles with elite coaches.  Bron won them with decent coaches.  That is my only point.

		<document><![CDATA[@vettepassby35 Right, and not a one of them has been a elite coach.  If Bron played for Jackson, Pops or Kerr you would not be saying he puts coaches on hot seat.  Spoelstra, Brown, Blatt, Walton, Lue will not go down in anyone's top coaches list.]]></document>
