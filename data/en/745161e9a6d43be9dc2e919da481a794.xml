		<document><![CDATA[@tentacles_blue @JayneKayleah @GateauxAmmo @Zero_Burn_ @ToniQueene Thanks for the apology. Sometimes people use words they don’t realise are harmful, that’s understandable.

But instead of listenting to them or the reasons why, you’re speaking over them &amp; telling them to get over it when you have no idea how it feels.

		<document><![CDATA[@JayneKayleah @GateauxAmmo @tentacles_blue @Zero_Burn_ @ToniQueene It’s the fact that it’s used as a synonym for those things that makes it ableist. Same with “tone deaf”, “dumb” etc. The English language is absolutely filled with ableist terms, and for you to tell disabled people what is or isn’t ableist under THIS of all tweets is unbelievable]]></document>
